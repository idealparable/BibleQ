# "BibleQ" = Bible Question

This is a term I (see below about who I am and whether / how you should cite me if you refer to me) have used for a long time to summarize a type of notes / investigation-report about the Bible that is exclusively careful with its sound (reliable) logic and typically very thorough so important questions can be answered in a way that is much less speculative than common approaches, so we can actually make progress in learning more about God and his message, considering whole-Bible context whenever time is available for it.

I use "BibleQ" to refer to a particular topic question for each article here.

(Don't confuse with, as the note in my template article page on this mentions, the spurious "Q" gospel or other meanings involving snapping fingers etc.)

# About Me
I don't agree with releasing personal information such as identity online. **If you do know who I am, either in-person or for other online screennames, please *don't* pass on that information yourself.**

The exception is if you start by warning the person you're telling that they should not tell others who I am.

This is because it's important to have freedom to pursue, and express, the truth, without enabling anyone who may attempt to persecute me or those connected to me for it when they may have motivations to suppress knowledge of it.

We'd all love to see the world as a place without risk of that, but on many topics that isn't the case.

Remember the internet is instantly global.

What I do need to make clear is my lack of any formal credentials to speak as any kind of authority. I focus on ensuring my logic is sound and my knowledge of the premises' truth is accurate. This is for now at least done strictly for free, at some major risk to myself.

## Citing Me
Why would you? I'm nobody.

And please don't, as I prefer to remain anonymous. If you do, please first read what I said in the About Me section above.

And if you do, you can refer to me as "idealparable" (from the gmail address I chose for this site), and may link to this site.

However, still think twice about it, as I may refer people to this site both who I know online and in-person, and I'd rather minimize chances of being "doxxed."

But if you really must cite somebody and I'm the first source you found a fact from, please consider citing **instead** my sources directly (see below). In many cases I will name them in articles, though not usually in any formal format and I do not have a rule to require it, per se. I usually don't have time to add extensive links and quotes, which can take weeks to prepare for even one thorough article so must rely on memory often. I am often reviewing a point before I type it again in the sources below, however, even if I don't always mention it in the article to keep it concise and consistently styled, and focus on the state of current knowledge.

Often if I'm citing someone by name in an actual article (not here on this more generalized About page) it's more when I'm critiquing some of their reasoning (or lack of it where it should be in considering opposing logic before jumping to their conclusions), so people can know who to look up to see their own side of such cases.

## Recommended Sources

Some sources you can look at to likely learn much of what I know are:

### Bible (Obviously)

- The Bible. Seriously, it's vital that you do whole-Bible readthroughs.

  Search tools have their uses, but should ideally be reserved for things like trying to find again a passage you already remember from your readthrough, or such as using [Blue Letter Bible](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/1/1) or a similar tool's source-language word searches to see what isn't evident in a mere English translation about where else a word or related forms of the same root word are used.

  So often I see that sources who make an argument are showing apparent lack of awareness simply of passages in the Bible right from an English translation.

  That's not to say that the translations are guaranteed accurate, but rather that if you're going to present a view that seems to go against it, you should ideally show awareness of it at least, and preferably interact with it, showing legitimate evidence it doesn't mean what it might seem to. Though keep in mind they (and I) might not always have time to do so (and in many places online we're dealing with highly restrictive limits on how many words/characters we can use). But my point is that before forming your opinions you should have read the entire Bible at least twice.

  Also, don't do "read it in a year" things, at least not as your primary approach. It can be useful to do that as well, later, but first you should read it like you read any other pageturner.

  Don't rely on "memory verses", memory challenges, etc. Again, these can have value, but people often go awry thinking this is how you should prioritize your interaction with the Bible. This is almost completely foreign to how the original intended audience was expected to learn it, except that they did typically memorize it better than we often do, due to being an oral culture, which lent itself to better-practiced mental skills of memorization of long sections, or even entire works.

  Keep in mind no single verse, section, chapter, or even book of the Bible is meant to be read alone.
  
  Context is a major part of how biblical language worked; they typically had much smaller vocabularies than modern languages (with some areas of exceptions), with each word having often a wider range of meanings, selected for by contextual keys/cues/clues.

  Whenever I or anyone else cite just one verse, you should be reading back quite a ways and forward quite a ways around it, and carefully track the logic flow in the passages, and if your conscience prompts you to any possible meaning other than what you might have thought, research it. It may be the Holy Spirit, or even simply your own God-given conscience doing a good job.

  Also, ***NEVER*** take someone's word for it when they cite but do not show a Scriptural citation. Look it up. Every time, time allowing.

  Especially if someone is an opponent of the Bible.

  In my experience, they virtually always misinterpret, and often mis-cite, Scripture. It's shocking how often it is when you have a rule to always check.

  Even if someone is a Christian, if they're biblical, they, as I, want you to be doing this.

  I have been reluctantly forced to see where it's legitimately necessary to need to include only the quick citation (and ideally a link) when it's part of the logic flow of what I'm saying, and others sometimes do this appropriately too (though it's a lot rarer than I'd like), and you'll see this in my articles, especially in relevance/introduction/summary sections. How I advise reading such things is either splitscreen with the Bible on one side, or with a paper Bible or ideally another device with the BLB app or similar tool, and to help avoid losing track of what the person such as I was saying, just scroll back up and re-read once you have a better understanding of what they likely had in mind when they cited the passage, so you "receive" their communication of what they were trying to convey by the end of that. Yes, that can be a slow process. This is where written forms of communication really shine.

### Bible Websites, Apps

- In addition to [Blue Letter Bible](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/1/1), here are some other sites I use sometimes:

  - [BibleHub](https://biblehub.com/). Currently if you want to grab a large section of passages to copypaste without extra code or having to click a lot of buttons (as you will get from BLB), and it isn't so many that you might run into copyright problems, and you want a version other than the WEBP, this is probably the best site to go to. It also has a number of tools including for the source languages, and often comes up in google searches.

  - [Biblegateway.com](https://www.biblegateway.com/), which until recently I would recommend for raw copypasting over Biblehub, but Bible gateway's site and app have both recently turned into the annoying-ads-everywhere type of site. Still, if that doesn't bother you, the site is straightforward for simply reading a large number of English translations.

  There are undoubtedly other good sites and apps (often mentioned is the YouVersion app, but I've never tried it, so I don't know).
  
  Note that in the list of translations below I have some other major links you should check out, especially the NET link, which you won't find on my normal article pages usually, and LSB and WEBP, which you will.

### Recommended Bible Versions (Intro)

- A common question for those of us who only fluently know English is "which translation?"

  A somewhat poor answer often given is to rely on comparing many translations. That can be useful, but too many people think that should be your go-to option, paradoxically, in the days where virtually everybody can access tools like Blue Letter on their phones, in hand, anywhere (depending on service connectivity, etc.). Of course, BLB has a "Bibles" option in its list of tools too, as do most other such sites, in addition to the Interlinear. But your first recourse should be to the Interlinear, and try to study Hebrew and Greek as much as you can.

  Also, if you are anybody remotely related to making decisions about which languages are taught in a school you have any kind of control over, make sure Hebrew and then Greek are at the top of your list (and maybe Aramaic). I found in my own education that it was required that I take coursed in foreign languages, yet frustratingly these primary two languages of the Bible weren't available anywhere that I had access to.
  
  It should be considered scandalous that this isn't the case, generally, along with the scandal of how little education in logic and critical thinking can be found, even in self-described Christian education. Not to focus on the negative, but sometimes we tolerate extremely dangerous neglect in our society far too much. If an inspiring approach can instead be more effective, go for it.

  (For myself, I've gained a small amount of knowledge about those languages after the internet became more of an option after most of my education was complete, but this happened only after I no longer had as much freetime for such things, and couldn't afford to go deeper in debt to pay for a formal approach.)

  The good news is you can learn a lot simply by being often checking the interlinear of BLB, and focusing first on learning theoretical pronunciations of biblical-era Hebrew and Greek.

  I can usually slowly piece together how to pronounce some of the words there; they show the actual Hebrew (at the top for OT when you click a verse or as the default display if you click the Tools button) and Greek (top NT, bottom LXX), and the interlinear has their own transliteration system (although be warned it only currently shows the root form in website version -- and at one time the detailed in-between section of the interlinear also used to only show the source-language of the root form; that has been now fixed, but not the pronunciations).

  Be aware that BLB's website, if not logged in, defaults to KJV. It's best to save your favorite/bookmark links as to the first page of Genesis in your preferred translation.

  All translations that I'm aware of have some issues I've noticed, although I haven't kept extensive notes on the issues with them. This is true of all the translations I'll list below, so keep that in mind.

  #### Recommended Bible Versions (Main List)

    - New English Translation (NET), specifically at [this part](https://netbible.org/bible/Genesis+1) of their website. Read it full screen on a computer, and the right side should show their extensive scholarly translator's notes. I haven't yet had nearly as much time as I'd like to go through this, but this is a goldmine of insight into specific motivations of translators verse by verse, often not so easy to learn for other translations.
    
      I've seen a few cases where I'm aware of evidence they don't consider that their translation is at least questionable (though it's possible they were aware and had reasons they didn't mention to go the way they did), but often they give the specifics that strongly support a particular meaning.

    - [Legacy Standard Bible (LSV)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/1/1). Recommended recently (in 2024) by Answers in Genesis (by Ken Ham), now sold in paper form by AiG. Their translators have affirmed actual belief in a list of doctrines that translators of other versions unfortunately may include compromisers on. LSB is an attempted word-for-word translation.
    
      I haven't yet at time of writing this had time to fully read it, but I've been checking and using it extensively ever since KH's announcement and have so far found it generally better than others, including NET, although access to their reasoning is much more generalized than NET. [See their preface notes here (a must-read, and very easy to read)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/bibles/preface-to-the-legacy-standard-bible.cfm).

    - [World English Bible Public Domain (WEPB)](https://ebible.org/web/GEN01.htm). Unfortunately not available on BLB (don't confuse it with their Webster's Bible WEB). This is seemingly the best option for when you need to quote in written works or similar works from the Bible extensively, as it's intended for that purpose. Most other translations have required limits on how much you can quote them from.
    
      I agree with the WEBP's thinking on this, but it's understandable that workers want their wages, and that's biblically supported by Paul. In terms of the translation, I haven't noticed too much of the effect of "you get what you pay for" here, but since it isn't on BLB that's a major downside, and their navigation is comparably poor at time of writing. What flaws I have noticed seem to be as common in other translations including the ones listed above.

#### Other Bible Versions (List)

  Other translations that have useful value include, but are not limited to:

  - ESV (English Standard Version), described as word for word style, though you won't find as much clarity in the verses themselves on this as with LSB. Unfortunately, evidently at least one translator who worked on this is a known compromiser, from what I heard mentioned in passing (without explanation) in Ken Ham's announcement on the new LSB version. I don't know the details. In general, ESV is very good, though, and should be a go-to version from among the more populist translations.

  - NASB95 (New American Standard Bible 1995), the version LSB is based on. LSB made arguments against the NASB20 which made sense to me (from interview by Ken Ham on his YouTube channel; I haven't found further statements of that in text yet, but [this page](https://lsbible.org/origin/) does mention LSB works from the 95 version). I haven't personally read this much myself; I'm noting it more due to LSB's relationship to it.

  - NIV84 (New International Version), a very popular thought-for-thought translation in the 1990s. Unfortunately "NIV" without clarifications of which year-version had been plagued by scandal about potentially less faithful translations in more recent updated versions. The LSB and WEB both represent a commitment, so they say, to avoiding continued tampering with the aspects of the language that are motivated by language politics as opposed to genuine changes in the meanings of common English words.
  
    NIV84, though, is good for getting perhaps a somewhat more likely idea of what the meaning the author was trying to convey is, in a way that more naturally fits the modern English language. So it's worth reading this at least once in your life. Unfortunately it seems that BLB's NIV is a more recent version according to its [preface](https://www.blueletterbible.org/bibles/preface-to-the-new-international-version.cfm).
    
Again, there are many other versions. The above is more of what I have read and would recommend for various reasons and why, not intended to imply a recommendation against versions not on the lists. Over time I may expand the lists; we'll see.

### Vital Extrabiblical Sources (Modern)

#### Social Context, Scholarship Review

- [James Patrick (JP) Holding of Tektonics.org](https://tektonics.org/). I found him through his articles and mentions from CMI (of creation.com; read on). He has described himself as not a scholar, but perhaps an "informed researcher," and I've found an excellent focus on logic, and thorough research. He is a library scientist, specializing in proper methodology of use of sources.

  He focuses better than most on proper biblical interpretation in light of their cultural rules of use of language "onboard" in his own works, and has an excellent, must-read page of scholarly sources on this. If there is any single source every modern Christian who wants to pursue, as JPH calls it, discipleship, growing in the knowledge of our faith, of apologetics, etc., he's it.
  
  Due to my own limited storage space, I rely on e-books from his recommended list, but that's more than sufficient to gain a good understanding of how to understand the Bible correctly. Do note that one of the names at the top of the list should be taken with a lot of salt (note it's stated as recommended by someone else who works with JPH, keeping in mind JPH himself has written for CMI, although it isn't his primary focus, one of the main critic organizations of John Walton, the name in question (not of the TV show)). And reviewing the list, either some were added or (more likely) I only bought some of them, so I can only recommend some of the e-books on this list.

  Here is the [list](https://www.tektonics.org/books/socialbooks.php). Specifics I'd recommend as essentials (copypasting author/title lines from JPH's page here):
    - David deSilva, Honor, Patronage, Kinship and Purity
    - Bruce Malina and John Pilch, Handbook of Biblical Social Values
    - Bruce Malina and Richard Rohrbaugh, Social Science Commentary on the Synoptic Gospels
    - E. Randolph Richards and Richard James, Misreading Scripture With Individualist Eyes
  
  He also has many must-read e-books of his own, especially the Contextual Encyclopedia of Biblical Inerrancy, without thorough knowledge of which nobody today should ever be commenting on alleged Bible contradictions (unfortunately, I'm currently unable to find a link to this; I have the e-books, and JPH has a video promoting it, but the link there is dead, and google and Amazon both seem to know nothing about it, nor could I find more than a mention of it on his site, but much of the findings in it are scattered across his site's articles still), and other books ([Amazon page](https://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B00LS1AB36/allbooks?ingress=0&visitId=55661e6a-06af-41fa-98d2-c9675d49362c&ref_=ap_rdr), [page on his site](https://tektonics.org/pubs.php)). He has said that he relies heavily on many commentaries when he reads the Bible as well.
  
  His writing style is also often very concise and to the point (much better than my own as you may notice), and [his site's hub page](https://www.tektonics.org/menus.php) and search feature (top of page at his [site](https://www.tektonics.org/menus.php)) are very effective, so it's typically easy to find anything crucial that you need to know about aspects of the Bible that you may find a critic whining about, or majorly debated on some other topics. (Note the hub page has both a by-Bible-book section and a topical section.)
  
  He's also well-known for one of our most important sound supports of the resurrection of Christ, his [Impossible Faith](https://www.tektonics.org/lp/nowayjose.php) argument.

- Glenn Miller of ChristianThinkTank.com. He's the most often cited source by JPH, often going even more in-depth in extended analysis and quotes from scholarly sources. Many of JPH's crucial topics are rooted in GM's extensive analysis.

  Between JPH and GM, I've noticed that most who seem to find many passages mysterious or concerning display consistent lack of awareness of the data they highlight, or fail to logically connect the dots in the biblical way they do.

#### Genesis, Origins Science

- [Answers in Genesis (AiG)](https://answersingenesis.org/)
- [Creation Ministries International (CMI, of creation.com)](https://creation.com/)
- [Institute of Creation Research (ICR)](https://www.icr.org/)
- [Creation Research Society (CRS)](https://www.creationresearch.org/). AiG, CMI, and ICR are the main three sites I follow, but CRS is often cited for their journal. They offer a way to obtain access to and download all their journal volumes, which I did at one point, so I can check sources from them when cited by, for example, CMI.
- [Woodmorappe, Noah's Ark, a Feasibility Study](https://www.amazon.com/Noahs-Ark-Feasibility-John-Woodmorappe/dp/0932766412). Only available in paper, unfortunately. I try not to recommend such books, but this one is an essential for anybody wanting to comment on plausibility of Noah's Ark. CMI does have many free articles that summarize much of it, and it's noted that the book is somewhat out of date, but it goes through every major topic of ark feasibility and cites scientific sources backing it up, using a principle of generosity to the skeptic (such as running the calculations with the maximum possible interpretation of how many baramins were on the ark, showing that even then there's plenty of space left over, as one example).

  I have digital photos of every page of this book I can check if asked for specifics, although image-only so it's not exactly searchable, and I can't share them presumably for copyright reasons. As with CRS's journal it's an option I can check for details when needed, though not easily.

- [Dr. Russel Humphreys, Starlight and Time](https://www.amazon.com/Starlight-Time-Russell-Humphreys-ebook/dp/B003BVJCQI/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=), and all CMI articles following. The question of distant starlight is one of the only legitimately big "problems" remaining today, and his suggested (not self-endorsed per se) model in this book is foundational to why it is not a definite problem today, although we don't yet know which of several options is correct. And if they were all to be ruled out, we would not know whether another option not thought of yet would fit.

  On this I'd also recommend both AiG's and CMI's books of basic questions and answers (the titles escape me at the moment and out of time to try to find out), which list the current state of knowledge on this well.

  Dr. Humphreys also accurately predicted the magnetic field strength of Mercury based on a model from his interpretation of Genesis and Peter, making him one of the most credible scientists alive today (at time of writing). See also TalkOrigins entry in the list later here of sources NOT to recommend, for an incident that has made accurate representation of Humphreys a sort of litmus test of whether someone is really informed on the subject or not.

- [Dr. Nathaniel Jeanson]. Speaking of scientists with accurate testable predictions, Dr. Jeanson's work has been some of the most important and successful today. His books are a must-read (Replacing Darwin, and Traced). During 2020 Covid, his YouTube series on this with Ken Ham was extremely popular, and well worth it. I recommend watching it first, and then reading Replacing Darwin, then Traced.

- Dr. John Baumgardner. He has the current scientific model of the global Flood, generally most supported by mainstream creationists. I have focused on this and see it as reaching the level of proven beyond a level of reasonable doubt. Admittedly a somewhat lower level than some topics (much lower than the Bible itself for example), but very solid. Specifically I read the in-depth written debate between him and Michael Oard, who is okay on a lot of topics, but his Flood model doesn't seem to make nearly as much sense of the physical evidence as Baumgardner's.

  Speaking of Oard and Flood models, however, Oard's review of the rather strange model of Walt Brown should be read if you're interested in this topic. See also Standing for Truth below.

- [CreationWiki]() I don't know who maintains this, but if you can't find a topic related to origins on the other go-to sites, it's always worth checking here. I can't vouch for reliability, but they may at least have information on more obscure topics others might not.

- [Standing for Truth](https://www.youtube.com/@StandingForTruthMinistries). A YouTube channel, primarily of a creationist named Donny Budinski. See also [Young Earth Creation](https://www.youtube.com/@YoungEarthCreation), the owner of which seems to be affiliated with SFT. Some caution is needed as far as trusting their views, which nobody should rely on anyway, as they do seem to support Kent Hovind and Walt Brown. Hovind may have some good material, and seems to mean well, but he has been called out for using arguments that are on lists of bad arguments by the mainstream creationist sites.

  Walt Brown, as said above, has a Flood model that has been seriously called into question. Mike Oard was asked to investigate it since Oard has opposed Baumgardner's model and thus has less risk of bias for it over Brown's. I can't definitively call Baumgardner's absolutely proven over Brown's, and I haven't studied the latter, but then he also has refrained for unclear reasons from publishing actual scientific papers on it, which doesn't speak well to his own confidence in it.

  SFT has made the argument that Baumgardner's model requires miracles, and that Baumgardner himself had criticized Brown's model for evidently needing the same. But from what I saw of Oard's review of Brown, this was actually a legitimate criticism if it is as SFT represented it (I don't know where Baumgardner said this or what the exact wording actually was), because Oard reports that Brown actaully claimed that his model works purely with normal physics. So Baumgarder would have been making an internal consistency criticism, evidently, on Brown's mode, not saying that there is a rule over all models that they can't allow for miracles. Of course they can. That said, it does seem that Baumgardner's model isn't proven to require them, and a recent video on the Young Earth Creation channel in fact argued that it doesn't, interestingly.

  In general, SFT is open-minded and willing to show all perspectives fairly, and has been cited by credible mainstream sources like Dr. Robert Carter, a geneticist with CMI, and often has interviews with similarly credible sources, not just with the more questionable ones like Hovind. The channel also does a number of other topics, and Budinsky himself focuses on some aspects of genetics with much good evidence, and arguments also used by Carter, etc.

- [Apologetics 101](https://www.youtube.com/@apologetics-101). YT channel. He does extremely thorough reviews of some subjects, following up on details, consulting experts. He's on the much-less-well-known side of sources on such subjects, but happened to have done a lot of work related to chimp/human DNA similarity arguments (not as a geneticist, but that he focused on the topic in a reliable way is much appreciated), which was an argument I was recently asked to look into, so it was nice to find that he already had. See below list of bad or more questionable sources about Erica "Gutsick Gibbon".

- Danny Faulkner, of AiG. He has many astrophysics-related topics, and is also well known for covering the topic of the disturbing rise in (supposed) belief in the Flat Earth or dome sky in recent years, falling for a scam promoted by biblioskeptics, falsely portraying the Bible as teaching it. His book *Falling Flat* is an excellent debunking of the scientific aspects of that error.

  His focus on the biblical aspects could use more research; I'd recommend JP Holding much more on that, but it's worth considering Faulkner's POV on that too, as he spends a lot of time in the subject, fairly hearing out Flat-Earthers more than probably anyone else among biblical Christians. I have some findings of my own on this that I haven't seen others cover. I hesitate to rely on my own opinion but I may include articles here eventually about some of it. In any case, for the vast majority of arguments used by skeptics and self-described Christian promoters of the Flat-Earth, or the arguments that the Bible teaches it or related things, Faulkner's books and articles, and some videos, and JPH's content should be more than enough to make it clear it, well, as Faulkner's book title says, falls quite flat.

- Vocab Malone. I haven't focused on him much, but he deals with some topics that may be of interest or importance to some, especially dealing with the bizarre "Black Hebrew Israelite" (yes, that isn't a typo) movement. Vocab is another friend of David Wood, also seen in his Islamicize Me comedy.



### Other Extrabiblical Sources (Modern)

- [David Bentley Hart, Experience of God (book)](https://www.amazon.com/Experience-God-Being-Consciousness-Bliss/dp/0300166842). I don't know much about him, but the book was brought to my attention as it touches on some of my subjects, in its first third. He does make a strong, mostly solid case in that section for proof of God, some of the same deductions I had arrived at on my own. Some of my content on the subject is now influenced by his arguments here.

  However, he weirdly strawmans biblical creationists (apparently meaning mainstream ones?) as believing in some lesser definition of God, which they don't, affirming quite the opposite. He would have done well to research that more, or back up who he meant by that if he did find someone more obscure who does teach it. In any case, the lesser definition he criticizes is actually commonly treated as a strawman (straw god) by biblioskeptics (perhaps getting it from those more obscure creationists Hart may have actually meant, unclear), so it's a relevant point in that way at least.

  The other two sections of the book are interesting, but I find the middle one problematic and potentially circular, but still possible. (The full title is The Experience of God: Being, Consciousness, Bliss, and those three final words are his three topics; the middle is argument from lack of understanding of consciousness.) Let's be blunt -- a sharp biblioskeptic will simply call this god of the gaps argumentation. He tries to say that we will not ever be able to understand consciousness, but it's unclear how this related to God at all, or even could ever be proven (it reads like Black Swan fallacy). I do think it may be somewhat on the right track, though; it's possible that consciousness is defined in a way rooted in God, but if he was trying to say something along these lines it was unclear to me.

  The third section isn't necessarily problematic, and could be of importance, but isn't my focus. In any case, I can recommend the book for the strength of the first argument, which is one of the most crucial topics, proving general theism. This by itself doesn't prove the Bible specifically (we have much other support that does), but it's the other major topic in addition to that, that matters most to humans.

  There may be many other books much better than this, etc. -- I have limited knowledge on all of that, but since this one was brought to my attention and is helpful, I might as well include it in this recommendation list, for whatever that's worth.

- Alien Incursion, book from CMI. Presents the interesting premise, with evidence, that supposed alien abduction events may really be deception by demons, as there's a pattern noticed even by secular researchers that these activities tend to stop when Jesus' name is called on by those whose lives fit a pattern of genuine faith.

  It's possible to wonder if this might be some kind of placebo effect, but it's at least a must-read for anyone wanting to figure out what's going on with the popular claims he's considering here about aliens, "UFOs," etc. (Some of the UFO sightings may be associated with the same demons, though I think on the whole these are just sightings of things like a satellite at sundown or sunrise. Interestingly, the Behavior Panel (see later) has interviewed one such "experiencer" and seemed to think he was honest.)

  Possibly more problematic is his chapter on the Nephilim, which is a complicated topic. His conclusion on it may be right, and is one of two popular interpretations throughout history, so it has extremely strong historical precedent, but like most on the topic, he doesn't engage reasonably with the simple option of humans strong enough in the violent times, potentially gathering gangs/armies/etc., to have their own little tyrannies, which we have today, so it should be expected then. Nor points about the terminology and its variation that could plausibly, apparently, explain the text. I'm still not sure what view on this topic should be considered the leader. I'll probably try to put together an article on this at some point.

- Strobel. Lee, of the Case of Christ, a must-read on apologetics about Christianity, especially the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ. Famous for having investigated it as a skeptic heavily biased against it (so he claims; I can see skeptics reasonably thinking he was just biased toward wanting to believe what his wife came to believe, but he seems genuine, and his argumentation is very strong).

  Also I've read his Case for Heaven. Both of those now have movie forms too. CMI argues against relying on NDEs (Near Death Experiences), and some of the seemingly strongest cases there seem questionable to me (the shoe on the edge of a roof, for example, why aren't we told where precisely line of sight could or could not have been earlier, on approach to the hospital, or if the person in question was unconscious at that point, etc.? But does seem like an extremely likely case).
  
  I want to believe a lot of what he has in here, and if you're going to take the topic on, the approach he used of only using the sources who (he thinks) have nothing to lose, is at least possibly good evidence. Certainly God is proven and is capable of all of that.
  
  The caution, though, is that the brain is naturally an engine for producing things like dreams, so it doesn't seem like that much of a stretch that it could produce other things, even with brainwave patterns unlike dreams, or no measurable brainwaves at one point only to possibly have the hallucination be generated later, etc. One case, if it's accurately reported, seems to still pass that test, of someone with no measurable brainwaves knowing things that happened in the room at that time.
  
  Regardless, there are other arguments there that seem stronger that don't depend on such things. I would go more with CMI on this, but if you're going to try to tackle the subject of the afterlife, it makes sense to take NDEs seriously in a thorough investigation.

  As for Stobel's other books I haven't read them at this time.

- Mike Winger. A pastor with a YouTube channel, does thorough analyses sometimes of some subjects. Unfortunately shows little knowledge of important facts sometimes, especially, as is unfortunately common, the findings of JPH/GM. He has a huge amount of content I haven't had time to watch most of, but most of what I have watched is still extremely good with those limitations taken into account.

- Nabeel Qureshi. A former Muslim, friend of David Wood (read on), sadly now passed away. He wrote two books covering well Islam, Christianity, etc. Highly recommended. Every Christian, indeed everyone, should probably read his books.

- Christian Prince. YouTube channel, by a Christian, I believe he has said of a middle eastern country, although my memory's unclear on precisely which one. He is extremely knowledgeable about Islam, the Quran, the Hadith, etc. and does a sort of radio-style (although showing sources onscreen) show showing problems with Islam in great detail. Some of his arguments seem a bit questionable to me, but if you want in-depth knowledge, virtually every Christian focused on the subject looks to him as a sort of legend. He typically only accepts Muslim callers and walks them through the problems, often helping lead them to Christ very rapidly.

  Be aware he often removes his shows later. A common problem today is leftists who abuse company "policies" and other things to take down anything that presents a view they don't like for peer-pressure reasons and similar fallacies, and he has been targeted by it as much as any. Often old videos are taken down for bogus reasons, and they give you (or did last I heard) a three-strikes-you're-out approach. David Wood (read on) even left YouTube because of it. CP's approach has been to just delete the videos, I think to preemptively remove the issue more. So you might only be able to follow him by catching his live shows, which usually have notifications. I haven't been able to keep up with him recently, but if you're at all interested in engaging Islam, you should probably include him, and follow him for at least a while, taking notes.

  Also there are many other channels that may keep copies of some of the more interesting segments, like when the infamous "Sheik" Uthman "Ibn Fibbin'" / "Footnote" (or "Ketchup") Farooq called into the show, failed miserably and later lied about it, trying to pretend it wasn't him (the voice is crystal clearly him), and countless other things that most Christians who know little to nothing about Islam would likely be shocked by among the shenanigans common to its promoters. For example, check out Rob Christian.

- Anthony Rogers. With a YouTube channel. Rogers, David Wood, and Sam Shamoun together did a show a long time ago about Islam, and together have a vast amount of knowledge about it. Rogers also does Trinity topics, the proper definition of saving faith in Christ, etc. with extremely good levels of knowledge. See also David Wood below... and unfortunately, Sam Shamoun went to the other list later... Read on.

- David Wood. The friend of Nabeel Qureshi mentioned earlier. He's a philosopher who focuses on Islam now. Interestingly, he says that he is a "diagnosed psychopath." Yes, he's serious about that, evidently. He went to prison for nearly killing his own dad, and found Christ there, convinced logically of it. He will lack a clear understanding, as he will readily admit openly, of human empathy, which is a bit disturbing, but it's certainly possible someone with the psychopathy disorder could still come to Christ.

  Regardless of any qualms you might have as far as trusting his credibility as a result, you don't really need to, because his value is that he will give you a lot of the data you need to evaluate Islam, and see through its many deceptions. Along with Christian Prince, he's generally seen as the most important Christian apologist focusing on Islam specifically. He also will not shy away from calling Islam on its crazier problems.
  
  Many Muslim promoters also like to use emotionalist cheats such as intimidation; this ironically doesn't work on DW. His videos are also often among the most entertaining on the subject, oddly enough. Although he deleted his entire channel at one point as mentioned earlier, he has put most of the videos on other sites beyond YouTube, and he now has his own site, and still has his newer content be posted to YouTube by others.

  Having read a book on psychopathy recommended by the Behavior Panel, I see some concerns here that could fairly be had with him, beyond the obvious, in that a common trait of it is an inability to actually follow logic well. So it's a bit odd that Wood is so logical and is even a philosopher. But the book does say the levels of this vary and some psychopathy might be genetic while other cases of it might not be. Given how Wood has described his upbringing, I wonder if he may be a case of the latter. In any case, he's a source worth following on the subject.

- [Whaddo You Meme??](https://www.youtube.com/@whaddoyoumeme). YouTube Channel. Very informed, evidently at least somewhat aware of JPH's work as he has cited it once that I've seen, and very good at parsing what people mean, as the title says. You might also recommend him from David Wood's spoof Islamicize Me. He focuses a lot on the core of the Christian message of salvation, and what it does and doesn't mean. Some of his older content seems to be the more "meaty," but he still puts out good content. Especially recommended is his takedown of the skeptic formerly known as CosmicSkeptic who had put together a series of bad arguments against the Bible on slavery. WYM's reply to it is one of the best I've ever seen on the subject.

- GK Chesterton's Orthodoxy. That, other than his excellent Father Brown detective stories, is all I've read from Chesterton at time of writing, but it's well worth the read. Even if you just want entertainment value. You can't understand modern society until you've read that book. Now, evidently he did become a Catholic, which I see problems with. But then perhaps I'm wrong, and Chesterton knew why, and I haven't figured it out yet. (I could be wrong, now. But I don't think so!)

- The Behavior Panel (YouTube channel). Not exactly on-topic, and they seem to be standard Old-Earthers, but I follow them (although I haven't kept up as much lately, as their videos are typically very long), and the relevance of their top expertise in body language and similar topics is often indirectly relevant to pretty much any topic. The books written by them are worth a read too.

## Sources to be wary of

Some on this list are extremely bad, others are generally good. Don't read too much into their being in the same list, for sake of brevity. Others on the recommended list above have issues too. Anybody with issues reaching at least a certain level of a sense that I can't just "recommend" them goes on this list, and some are on this list because you should definitely take everything they say with a whole salt shaker.

- Hugh Ross. Huge Errors. Sadly some Christians naive on the topic of origins recommend this highly problematic Old-Earther, but aside from many poor arguments such as treating poetic passages as "creation accounts," this is the guy who hired two people to write critiques of Dr. Humphreys, in which it was clear that they don't understand the distinction between a universe of matter with an edge and one without, despite this being crucial to understanding Humphreys' model that they were critiquing. Most critics of Humphreys rely on those sources uncritically.

  While it's possible he just made a mistake of signing off on something he didn't fact-check, since Ross himself didn't write it, AiG and CMI have documented many highly concerning behaviors, claims, and bad arguments used by Ross. Please don't recommend him.

- John Walton? Mentioning because this was the name at the top of the JPH social sources I mentioned above. I haven't read his works personally, but have read reviews and arguments against his credibility seem reasonable. Others have asked me about some of his reasoning which they passed onto me.

  Fundamentally, if they represented him correctly, he would be missing the biblical priority of physical symbols -- that is, things that do literally physically exist, which typically go with major covenants (and an Adamic original covenant of God's "if you do this, this is the result" statement is likely implied about not eating of the forbidden tree), and help serve as direct visual reminders to people of the time.
  
  This is likely the case of the two key trees in Eden -- real physical trees, serving as a symbolic way for God to tell Adam and Eve essentially, choose which future the tree of your descendants will have.
  
  Also the Hebrew for tree, erets, may be related to the word for earth/soil/land, ets (although it's spelled differently), or a play on words may be intended here, signifying that whatever they chose, the effects would literally apply to the whole of the Earth and its future inhabitants.
  
  The symbolic significance should be read as a materially-real focal point of simplifying the choice they had to make into one highly significant yet easily understandable command.

  Walton has become popular in certain circles, and his central idea, of a "Cosmic Temple," is something of a byword among Old-Earthers looking to reinterpret the Bible while blindly, uncritically trusting popular "science" of our current era (circa 2000 AD). I can't say much more beyond that without having read his book, but based on all of the above, I find this idea suspect. From what I can see of what else is represented about him online, he comes across as trying to promote a potentially deceptive approach of making revisionist Old-Eartherism appear to be the return to understanding the Bible on its own terms. As CMI/etc. have proven extensively, and as another name on my recommended list might say, "The precise opposite is the case!"

- Inspiring Philosophy. This is a popular self-described Christian apologist, going by that YouTube screenname. I have seen some from him that is somewhat decent, but tread carefully. I've also seen him shamefully attacking Answers in Genesis, claiming without evidence that the organization "lies" (!), and he promotes Walton and other questionable views. Also he stole the acronym IP that I want for IdealParable, my gmail handle. So. Yeah. (I'm not listing his name, which is known, although he uses it, because he did mention at one point that I happened to see, I forget where or why, that this became known because he was doxxed, and he hadn't wanted to be. To me that's a big deal, so I won't be passing it on.)

- Sean Finnegan. A Unitarian who typically comes up if you google the topic. I've checked his arguments in detail. They're shockingly bad. At least, though, he actually makes more of them than most of them. It's difficult to get most of them to engage the topic. Ironically he was recently forced to admit to essentially the Trinitarian model, as highlighted by JP Holding, except he simply has Jesus as a created entity (made first before the world), so he simply takes the "beginningless" part out of our model. The irony is so ironic, it is already rusted. Aside from that, and to whatever extent he is actually better than most Unitarians I've seen, I've caught him in much apparent deception, so be careful if you try to follow his arguments. Fact-check every single word he says.

- "Rational" Wiki (and anything else by biblioskeptics). And by the way, Wikipedia. Basically the same difference. This is basically the absolute dregs of Old-Eartherism. However, it's good to know what the dregs say. Just keep in mind the extreme unreliability, often intentional deception, etc. of the site if you do go there. Sometimes to cover a topic thoroughly, it's the only place I've been able to find at least attempted counterarguments by evolutionists against some of our "side's" arguments. But don't confuse that with credibility. In fact, don't confuse anything about evolutionists with credibility.

- TalkOrigins. I used to recommend this as at least representing the evolutionist side in some level of detail. However, they were famously caught passing on a clear misrepresentation of Dr. Russel Humphrey's Starlight and Time model, as saying distant starlight should be *blue*shifted -- now. His book clearly said the exact opposite; that it's expanding now, and should be (and is) redshifted. This error has been called out for now approaching two decades, and it's still there on their site's main index. Clearly they don't fact-check. And that's just one of many dismal problems. You can pretty much dispense with the site entirely. Admittedly, there isn't anything good to recommend in its stead.

  (Don't even think about the NSCE. Woodmorappe's book was a debunking of their Glenn Morton, and his extremely outdated article against the ark is STILL there, promoted as if it represented current knowledge. This sort of problem is pervasive -- indeed universal among evolutionists as far as I have been able to find, but that is, of course, unsurprising, since those buying into a wrong view will generally, and to some extent unavoidably, be the ones willing to be unreasonable.)

- ~ Sam Shamoun. I put "~" for so-so, as Sam has much to commend him, much more than most on this list. He is the one mentioned earlier as having done the famous show with David Wood and Anthony Rogers against Islam. He's always been a bit unusual, but some of his issues rise to the level that I can't recommend him, at least not without much caution (which you should have anyway for everyone). He recently has endorsed a works-based model of salvation.

  It's true that works are highly relevant to salvation, but as evidence of genuine saving faith, and results from it, not as part of what you have to get it. He puts some of the work of salvation on humans instead of on Christ. His friend Anthony Rogers and he have sadly been stuck in a back and forth on this. Rogers says that Sam is still a friend, but Shamoun has become known for attacking anyone for simply questioning him on this.
  
  Sadly it all could have been avoided, as so much can, if he had just been aware of JP Holding's material on this. Saving faith is, as Holding has shown, essentially the same concept as today's term "loyalty" (to Christ, based on genuine belief, from knowledge of sound support, and a choice of will to trust and want to serve and obey Christ). The works follow from the loyalty, but don't earn us the loyalty. It's possible for attempts to practice good works to help us see why God is right to tell us that's how we should be, and lead to loyalty, but the works themselves don't earn us anything.

  It's also true that it's sin that causes our problem, but doing more good works later can't cancel out the payment demanded by the past sins. Only Christ's atonement could do that. (That, or our taking the punishment ourselves if we reject his free gift of salvation, which is what happens to those who refuse it even to death and are imprisoned in hell.) When we accept Christ, genuinely, the Holy Spirit indwells in us, to help guide us away from sin in this life, and at the entrance to heaven God removes the sin nature entirely from us. It's because we will then be sinless from that point on that our salvation is secure (don't confuse that with the ambiguous phrase "once saved always saved," though, which doesn't clearly define what sense of "saved" is meant; it doesn't necessarily mean once dunked, saved). So in a sense, that our good works will be all that will follow from that point, is indeed why we're allowed still in heaven. But this is purely from God, through Christ, and the Holy Spirit, not anything in and of ourselves. Left to ourselves, we could never reach that perfect state, and the Spirit will still be there guiding us; his indwelling isn't just a temporary thing because of the sin nature, but it's what mere finite humans will always need. *We* will never be able (on our own) to perfectly avoid all sin like the omniscient God can; we will always need his help. Christ's atonement is crucial, and wholly sufficient, to bridge that gap. So we *will* be "able" to perfectly avoid all sin -- because it isn't our own ability causing that, but God's only.

  The key problem here is that a perfect God can't abide sin at all, and until Christ paid the price for it, that meant the Spirit couldn't indwell us to guide us. Nothing good we could ever do, or no amount of avoiding future sins, could ever solve this problem, to any slight extent. Only Christ could.

  It's sad that Shamoun and those he rallies to his cause can't see that, but at least it gives us an opportunity to call attention to this vital topic. Our lives literally depend on getting this right.

  Shamoun is still worth considering following if you have a ton of extra time. He has a useful talent of having a photographic-memory-like recall of biblical passages, as if he is a living search tool for the Bible. On many subjects this talent is sufficient for him to clearly demonstrate why he's right. For whatever reason, though, on salvation, and possibly others, he can't seem to bring himself to admit to connecting the dots. Perhaps because it's more complicated and the problem goes beyond mere recall. Some might think that his memory talent makes him guaranteed to be right, and that we simply lack an understanding that you would need his ability to recall the whole Bible to see.
  
  While it's difficult to argue against that if he can't present what we should know (I've followed his videos on this for a while and at least in the early ones, he didn't; as Anthony Rogers has shown in detail, and most of it was preemptively covered unintentionally by JPH's content), another problem with such an argument is it would imply that Shamoun is virtually unique among humans in being able to understand what we must do to be saved. It seems highly unlikely that God would hide the knowledge of that in such an obscure way and refrain from allowing salvation to be easily accessible and understandable to all. And then at that evidently make this one guy we would need unable to explain it to the rest of us.

- Erica "Gutsick Gibbon". Another source who was doxxed, and I know her last name as a result, but evidently she didn't want to reveal that, although she does reveal her first name intentionally, oddly, and has a bizarre practice of giving out her last name to some people as well without warning them not to tell others (she did this to a Dr. Buggs). Anyway, I was asked to review some of her endlessly spammy videos against a Dr. Tomkins of ICR, who is one of the main sources for the idea that human/chimp DNA similarity is probably somewhere in the 80s range of percent (Buggs is as well). She has come up before for a popular video against Dr. Robert Carter. It became clear that "GG" (Erica) uses extremely poor reasoning, and is (of course) guilty of the very things she accused Tomkins of. In one case she was forced to admit this recently (in 2024), but still has the gall to act condescendingly toward creationists. Don't waste your time.

- Richard Dawkward. I mean Dawkins. Famous for intelligently designing a computer program hardcoding a target sequence of letters in from the start, and then somehow "thinking" it evidences anything other than special creation (or hoping his readers are extremely gullible), as well as actually conflating the fully infinite God with little-g-finite prospective gods, and basing actual arguments on their supposed equivalence, on topics anybody with a brain can see aren't equivalent.

- Dan Barking Mad Barker. Infamous for, aside from being associated with the financial bully organization, the Freedom From Freedom Foundation (or they say from Religion, but they try to take away your religious freedom; let's call them what they are), hilariously thinking that he found the "real" ten commandments, in Exodus 34, failing to read verse 1, which clearly says that the Lord would write the actual 10Cs on the replacement tablets, and thus misunderstanding verse 27's "write these words" as a command to Moses to write them as the "actual" ten commandments (the "don't boil a young goat" ones) on the stone tablets.

  It clearly says instead that Moses was to write these separately, not on stone, likely as application, *while* God wrote the 10Cs we were already told in Exodus 20. Barker was basing this on failing to understand Hebrew use of multiple consecutive pronouns for different referrents in verse 28 of chapter 34, projecting a popular modern English pseudo-rule against it onto Hebrew culture. If you just read the conversation between the LORD God and Adam in Genesis 3, you clearly see that Hebrew didn't have such a rule. Instead, it used context to specify which was which, and Exodus 34:1 is that context.

  For a while, this silly accusation made the rounds among populist skeptics, and might still show up, although I haven't seen it used in a whlie. I'm not sure if it actually originated from Mad Barker, but he's the most prominent source I'm aware of, that I had reviewed.

- Cult of Dusty, a YT channel antibiblicist, once popular among skeptics, made the "hall of shame" for actually arguing that he had "disproven" the 40 years wandering of Israel with a map app (seriously... it seems that he wasn't joking from how he acted after he was caught even by his own followers). Because Israel is so close to Egypt it doesn't take 40 years to walk there. Seriously. I'm dead serious, that was his argument. Maybe it's a long-con bad joke? But it seemed like he really thought this was a good argument.

  When he was "caught," (as in his own fanboys, usually the fawning yes-men gullible "skeptics" who believe (supposedly) any argument another skeptic makes, actually knew why this is one of the dumbest arguments any human being has ever breathed out) it even got worse, in that he tried to justify his colossal ignorance by circular reasoning -- assuming the Bible is like myths, and that it was never worth his time to know the "myths" well know to know what the heck he was talking about. Yeah. Jaw drop moments.

  On the off chance anybody reading this might not know why that's a horrible argument (AKA, if someone is your typical "fundy atheist" as JPH calls them), the Bible makes it crystal clear it only took *two* years to arrive at Egypt, and it took that long because they intentionally camped for along time at Sinai (among other time spent camping at various other points along the way). The entire purpose of the 40 years wandering was punishment for their cowardly and treasonous reactions to the "ten bad" spies who went *into* Canaan to "spy" out the land. It wasn't about how long it took to reach Canaan. Yes, this is how bad the level of mis/un/mal-education is now, that there are people who speak English fluently (more or less) who don't even know such basics. Great job, humanity!

  Cult of Rusty-Brain also had a highly questionable video literally talking down to women for being smarter than him and not buying into pseudoskeptic claims about the Bible supposedly being anti-women. The video of him basically screaming at women in general for having their own will to choose something he doesn't like is deeply disturbing. Well-deserved is his fall to complete obscurity in recent years.

- "Dr. Josh" of some YouTube channel the name of which is escaping me at the moment. A low-level scholar focusing on often spurious accusations against the Bible on slavery. He "reviewed" Whaddo You Meme's videos on the topic, and had the audacity to refuse to even deal with WYM's central and most important point, that the Mosiac Law constantly urged fair and equal treatment of all, including foreigners, even though "Dr. Josh" had a premise against this as a basic core of his argument.

  He also literally claimed that the Law said that poor people shouldn't be around because God would miraculously make them rich, as if this was what the Bible meant, or even as if this would even be a problem (the passage in question said that there SHOULD not be poor among them if they all perfectly follow the law, which clearly they didn't, and it doesn't say this is due to any promise of miracles but due to good design of the law!).

  I also saw him on a show with some other skeptic of such ill repute as to not even bother naming (plus I forget the name now), and some other skeptic repeated the famously stupid argument of Cult of Dusty (see above), and Dr. Josh seemed to be awake and right there, and he didn't comment at all. He seemed to endorse it, incredibly. Many skeptics promote him as a reliable source. He's the opposite.

- There are countless others (like he of the famous Dillahunty Dodge), but most are so bad, it isn't worth even mentioning them.
