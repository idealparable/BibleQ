# "BibleQ" = Bible Question

This is a term I (see below about who I am and whether / how you should cite me if you refer to me) have used for a long time to summarize a type of notes / investigation-report about the Bible that is exclusively careful with its sound (reliable) logic and typically very thorough so important questions can be answered in a way that is much less speculative than common approaches, so we can actually make progress in learning more about God and his message, considering whole-Bible context whenever time is available for it.

I use "BibleQ" to refer to a particular topic question for each article here.

(Don't confuse with, as the note in my template article page on this mentions, the spurious "Q" gospel or other meanings involving snapping fingers etc.)
