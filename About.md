# "BibleQ" = Bible Question

This is a term I (see below about who I am and whether / how you should cite me if you refer to me) have used for a long time to summarize a type of notes / investigation-report about the Bible that is exclusively careful with its sound (reliable) logic and typically very thorough so important questions can be answered in a way that is much less speculative than common approaches, so we can actually make progress in learning more about God and his message, considering whole-Bible context whenever time is available for it.

I use "BibleQ" to refer to a particular topic question for each article here.

(Don't confuse with, as the note in my template article page on this mentions, the spurious "Q" gospel or other meanings involving snapping fingers etc.)

# About Me
I don't agree with releasing personal information such as identity online. **If you do know who I am, either in-person or for other online screennames, please *don't* pass on that information yourself.**

The exception is if you start by warning the person you're telling that they should not tell others who I am.

This is because it's important to have freedom to pursue, and express, the truth, without enabling anyone who may attempt to persecute me or those connected to me for it when they may have motivations to suppress knowledge of it.

We'd all love to see the world as a place without risk of that, but on many topics that isn't the case.

Remember the internet is instantly global.

What I do need to make clear is my lack of any formal credentials to speak as any kind of authority. I focus on ensuring my logic is sound and my knowledge of the premises' truth is accurate. This is for now at least done strictly for free, at some major risk to myself.

## Citing Me
Why would you? I'm nobody.

And please don't, as I prefer to remain anonymous. If you do, please first read what I said in the About Me section above.

But if you really must cite somebody and I'm the first place you found a fact, please consider citing instead my sources directly. In many cases I will name them, though not usually in any formal format and I do not have a rule to require it, per se.

Some sources you can look at to likely learn much of what I know are:

- [James Patrick (JP) Holding of Tektonics.org](https://tektonics.org/) and the prolific tektontv YouTube channel. I found him through his articles and mentions from CMI (of creation.com; read on). He has described himself as not a scholar, but perhaps an "informed researcher," and I've found an excellent focus on logic, and thorough research. He is a library scientist, specializing in proper methodology of use of sources.

  He focuses better than most on proper biblical interpretation in light of their cultural rules of use of language "onboard" in his own works, and has an excellent, must-read page of scholarly sources on this. If there is any single source every modern Christian who wants to pursue, as JPH calls it, discipleship, growing in the knowledge of our faith, of apologetics, etc., he's it. Due to my own limited storage space, I rely on e-books from his recommended list, but that's more than sufficient to gain a good understanding of how to understand the Bible correctly.
  
  He also has many must-read e-books of his own, especially the Encyclopedia of Biblical Inerrancy, without thorough knowledge of which nobody today should ever be commenting on alleged Bible contradictions, and other books ([Amazon page](https://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B00LS1AB36/allbooks?ingress=0&visitId=55661e6a-06af-41fa-98d2-c9675d49362c&ref_=ap_rdr), [page on his site](https://tektonics.org/pubs.php)). He has said that he relies heavily on many commentaries when he reads the Bible as well. His writing style is also often very concise and to the point (much better than my own as you may notice), and [his site's hub page](https://www.tektonics.org/menus.php) and search feature (top of page at his [site](https://www.tektonics.org/menus.php)) are very effective, so it's typically easy to find anything crucial that you need to know about aspects of the Bible that you may find a critic whining about, or majorly debated on some other topics. (Note the hub page has both a by-Bible-book section and a topical section.)
  
  He's also well-known for one of our most important sound supports of the resurrection of Christ, his [Impossible Faith](https://www.tektonics.org/lp/nowayjose.php) argument.

- Glenn Miller of ChristianThinkTank.com. He's the most often cited source by JPH, often going even more in-depth in extended analysis and quotes from scholarly sources. Many of JPH's crucial topics are rooted in GM's extensive analysis.

  Between JPH and GM, I've noticed that most who seem to find many passages mysterious or concerning display consistent lack of awareness of the data they highlight, or fail to logically connect the dots in the biblical way they do.
