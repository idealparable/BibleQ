# "BibleQ" = Bible Question

This is a term I (see below about who I am and whether / how you should cite me if you refer to me) have used for a long time to summarize a type of notes / investigation-report about the Bible that is exclusively careful with its sound (reliable) logic and typically very thorough so important questions can be answered in a way that is much less speculative than common approaches, so we can actually make progress in learning more about God and his message, considering whole-Bible context whenever time is available for it.

I use "BibleQ" to refer to a particular topic question for each article here.

(Don't confuse with, as the note in my template article page on this mentions, the spurious "Q" gospel or other meanings involving snapping fingers etc.)

# About Me
I don't agree with releasing personal information such as identity online. **If you do know who I am, either in-person or for other online screennames, please *don't* pass on that information yourself.**

The exception is if you start by warning the person you're telling that they should not tell others who I am.

This is because it's important to have freedom to pursue, and express, the truth, without enabling anyone who may attempt to persecute me or those connected to me for it when they may have motivations to suppress knowledge of it.

We'd all love to see the world as a place without risk of that, but on many topics that isn't the case.

Remember the internet is instantly global.

What I do need to make clear is my lack of any formal credentials to speak as any kind of authority. I focus on ensuring my logic is sound and my knowledge of the premises' truth is accurate. This is for now at least done strictly for free, at some major risk to myself.

## Citing Me
Why would you? I'm nobody.

And please don't, as I prefer to remain anonymous. If you do, please first read what I said in the About Me section above.

And if you do, you can refer to me as "idealparable" (from the gmail address I chose for this site), and may link to this site.

However, still think twice about it, as I may refer people to this site both who I know online and in-person, and I'd rather minimize chances of being "doxxed."

But if you really must cite somebody and I'm the first source you found a fact from, please consider citing **instead** my sources directly (see below). In many cases I will name them in articles, though not usually in any formal format and I do not have a rule to require it, per se. I usually don't have time to add extensive links and quotes, which can take weeks to prepare for even one thorough article so must rely on memory often. I am often reviewing a point before I type it again in the sources below, however, even if I don't always mention it in the article to keep it concise and consistently styled, and focus on the state of current knowledge.

Often if I'm citing someone by name in an actual article (not here on this more generalized About page) it's more when I'm critiquing some of their reasoning (or lack of it where it should be in considering opposing logic before jumping to their conclusions), so people can know who to look up to see their own side of such cases.

Some sources you can look at to likely learn much of what I know are:

- The Bible. Seriously, it's vital that you do whole-Bible readthroughs.

  Search tools have their uses, but should ideally be reserved for things like trying to find again a passage you already remember from your readthrough, or such as using [Blue Letter Bible](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/1/1) or a similar tool's source-language word searches to see what isn't evident in a mere English translation about where else a word or related forms of the same root word are used.

  So often I see that sources who make an argument are showing apparent lack of awareness simply of passages in the Bible right from an English translation.

  That's not to say that the translations are guaranteed accurate, but rather that if you're going to present a view that seems to go against it, you should ideally show awareness of it at least, and preferably interact with it, showing legitimate evidence it doesn't mean what it might seem to. Though keep in mind they (and I) might not always have time to do so (and in many places online we're dealing with highly restrictive limits on how many words/characters we can use). But my point is that before forming your opinions you should have read the entire Bible at least twice.

  Also, don't do "read it in a year" things, at least not as your primary approach. It can be useful to do that as well, later, but first you should read it like you read any other pageturner.

  Don't rely on "memory verses", memory challenges, etc. Again, these can have value, but people often go awry thinking this is how you should prioritize your interaction with the Bible. This is almost completely foreign to how the original intended audience was expected to learn it, except that they did typically memorize it better than we often do, due to being an oral culture, which lent itself to better-practiced mental skills of memorization of long sections, or even entire works.

  Keep in mind no single verse, section, chapter, or even book of the Bible is meant to be read alone.
  
  Context is a major part of how biblical language worked; they typically had much smaller vocabularies than modern languages (with some areas of exceptions), with each word having often a wider range of meanings, selected for by contextual keys/cues/clues.

  Whenever I or anyone else cite just one verse, you should be reading back quite a ways and forward quite a ways around it, and carefully track the logic flow in the passages, and if your conscience prompts you to any possible meaning other than what you might have thought, research it. It may be the Holy Spirit, or even simply your own God-given conscience doing a good job.

  Also, ***NEVER*** take someone's word for it when they cite but do not show a Scriptural citation. Look it up. Every time, time allowing.

  Especially if someone is an opponent of the Bible.

  In my experience, they virtually always misinterpret, and often mis-cite, Scripture. It's shocking how often it is when you have a rule to always check.

  Even if someone is a Christian, if they're biblical, they, as I, want you to be doing this.

  I have been reluctantly forced to see where it's legitimately necessary to need to include only the quick citation (and ideally a link) when it's part of the logic flow of what I'm saying, and others sometimes do this appropriately too (though it's a lot rarer than I'd like), and you'll see this in my articles, especially in relevance/introduction/summary sections. How I advise reading such things is either splitscreen with the Bible on one side, or with a paper Bible or ideally another device with the BLB app or similar tool, and to help avoid losing track of what the person such as I was saying, just scroll back up and re-read once you have a better understanding of what they likely had in mind when they cited the passage, so you "receive" their communication of what they were trying to convey by the end of that. Yes, that can be a slow process. This is where written forms of communication really shine.

- A common question for those of us who only fluently know English is "which translation?"

  A somewhat poor answer often given is to rely on comparing many translations. That can be useful, but too many people think that should be your go-to option, paradoxically, in the days where virtually everybody can access tools like Blue Letter on their phones, in hand, anywhere (depending on service connectivity, etc.). Of course, BLB has a "Bibles" option in its list of tools too, as do most other such sites, in addition to the Interlinear. But your first recourse should be to the Interlinear, and try to study Hebrew and Greek as much as you can.

  Also, if you are anybody remotely related to making decisions about which languages are taught in a school you have any kind of control over, make sure Hebrew and then Greek are at the top of your list (and maybe Aramaic). I found in my own education that it was required that I take coursed in foreign languages, yet frustratingly these primary two languages of the Bible weren't available anywhere that I had access to.
  
  It should be considered scandalous that this isn't the case, generally, along with the scandal of how little education in logic and critical thinking can be found, even in self-described Christian education. Not to focus on the negative, but sometimes we tolerate extremely dangerous neglect in our society far too much. If an inspiring approach can instead be more effective, go for it.

  (For myself, I've gained a small amount of knowledge about those languages after the internet became more of an option after most of my education was complete, but this happened only after I no longer had as much freetime for such things, and couldn't afford to go deeper in debt to pay for a formal approach.)

  The good news is you can learn a lot simply by being often checking the interlinear of BLB, and focusing first on learning theoretical pronunciations of biblical-era Hebrew and Greek.

  I can usually slowly piece together how to pronounce some of the words there; they show the actual Hebrew (at the top for OT when you click a verse or as the default display if you click the Tools button) and Greek (top NT, bottom LXX), and the interlinear has their own transliteration system (although be warned it only currently shows the root form in website version -- and at one time the detailed in-between section of the interlinear also used to only show the source-language of the root form; that has been now fixed, but not the pronunciations).

  Be aware that BLB's website, if not logged in, defaults to KJV. It's best to save your favorite/bookmark links as to the first page of Genesis in your preferred translation.

  All translations that I'm aware of have some issues I've noticed, although I haven't kept extensive notes on the issues with them. This is true of all the translations I'll list below, so keep that in mind.

    - New English Translation (NET), specifically at [this part](https://netbible.org/bible/Genesis+1) of their website. Read it full screen on a computer, and the right side should show their extensive scholarly translator's notes. I haven't yet had nearly as much time as I'd like to go through this, but this is a goldmine of insight into specific motivations of translators verse by verse, often not so easy to learn for other translations.
    
      I've seen a few cases where I'm aware of evidence they don't consider that their translation is at least questionable (though it's possible they were aware and had reasons they didn't mention to go the way they did), but often they give the specifics that strongly support a particular meaning.

    - [Legacy Standard Bible (LSV)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/1/1). Recommended recently (in 2024) by Answers in Genesis (by Ken Ham), now sold in paper form by AiG. Their translators have affirmed actual belief in a list of doctrines that translators of other versions unfortunately may include compromisers on. LSB is an attempted word-for-word translation.
    
      I haven't yet at time of writing this had time to fully read it, but I've been checking and using it extensively ever since KH's announcement and have so far found it generally better than others, including NET, although access to their reasoning is much more generalized than NET. [See their preface notes here (a must-read, and very easy to read)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/bibles/preface-to-the-legacy-standard-bible.cfm).

    - [world English Bible Public Domain (WEPB)](https://ebible.org/web/GEN01.htm). Unfortunately not available on BLB (don't confuse it with their Webster's Bible WEB)

- [James Patrick (JP) Holding of Tektonics.org](https://tektonics.org/) and the prolific tektontv YouTube channel. I found him through his articles and mentions from CMI (of creation.com; read on). He has described himself as not a scholar, but perhaps an "informed researcher," and I've found an excellent focus on logic, and thorough research. He is a library scientist, specializing in proper methodology of use of sources.

  He focuses better than most on proper biblical interpretation in light of their cultural rules of use of language "onboard" in his own works, and has an excellent, must-read page of scholarly sources on this. If there is any single source every modern Christian who wants to pursue, as JPH calls it, discipleship, growing in the knowledge of our faith, of apologetics, etc., he's it. Due to my own limited storage space, I rely on e-books from his recommended list, but that's more than sufficient to gain a good understanding of how to understand the Bible correctly.
  
  He also has many must-read e-books of his own, especially the Encyclopedia of Biblical Inerrancy, without thorough knowledge of which nobody today should ever be commenting on alleged Bible contradictions, and other books ([Amazon page](https://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B00LS1AB36/allbooks?ingress=0&visitId=55661e6a-06af-41fa-98d2-c9675d49362c&ref_=ap_rdr), [page on his site](https://tektonics.org/pubs.php)). He has said that he relies heavily on many commentaries when he reads the Bible as well. His writing style is also often very concise and to the point (much better than my own as you may notice), and [his site's hub page](https://www.tektonics.org/menus.php) and search feature (top of page at his [site](https://www.tektonics.org/menus.php)) are very effective, so it's typically easy to find anything crucial that you need to know about aspects of the Bible that you may find a critic whining about, or majorly debated on some other topics. (Note the hub page has both a by-Bible-book section and a topical section.)
  
  He's also well-known for one of our most important sound supports of the resurrection of Christ, his [Impossible Faith](https://www.tektonics.org/lp/nowayjose.php) argument.

- Glenn Miller of ChristianThinkTank.com. He's the most often cited source by JPH, often going even more in-depth in extended analysis and quotes from scholarly sources. Many of JPH's crucial topics are rooted in GM's extensive analysis.

  Between JPH and GM, I've noticed that most who seem to find many passages mysterious or concerning display consistent lack of awareness of the data they highlight, or fail to logically connect the dots in the biblical way they do.
