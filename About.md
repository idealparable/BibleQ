# "BibleQ" = Bible Question

This is a term I (see below about who I am and whether / how you should cite me if you refer to me) have used for a long time to summarize a type of notes / investigation-report about the Bible that is exclusively careful with its sound (reliable) logic and typically very thorough so important questions can be answered in a way that is much less speculative than common approaches, so we can actually make progress in learning more about God and his message, considering whole-Bible context whenever time is available for it.

I use "BibleQ" to refer to a particular topic question for each article here.

(Don't confuse with, as the note in my template article page on this mentions, the spurious "Q" gospel or other meanings involving snapping fingers etc.)

# About Me
I don't agree with releasing personal information such as identity online. **If you do know who I am, either in-person or for other online screennames, please *don't* pass on that information yourself.**

The exception is if you start by warning the person you're telling that they should not tell others who I am.

This is because it's important to have freedom to pursue, and express, the truth, without enabling anyone who may attempt to persecute me or those connected to me for it when they may have motivations to suppress knowledge of it.

We'd all love to see the world as a place without risk of that, but on many topics that isn't the case.

Remember the internet is instantly global.

What I do need to make clear is my lack of any formal credentials to speak as any kind of authority. I focus on ensuring my logic is sound and my knowledge of the premises' truth is accurate. This is for now at least done strictly for free, at some major risk to myself.

## Citing Me
Why would you? I'm nobody.

And please don't, as I prefer to remain anonymous. If you do, please first read what I said in the About Me section above.

And if you do, you can refer to me as "idealparable" (from the gmail address I chose for this site), and may link to this site.

However, still think twice about it, as I may refer people to this site both who I know online and in-person, and I'd rather minimize chances of being "doxxed."

But if you really must cite somebody and I'm the first source you found a fact from, please consider citing **instead** my sources directly (see below). In many cases I will name them in articles, though not usually in any formal format and I do not have a rule to require it, per se. I usually don't have time to add extensive links and quotes, which can take weeks to prepare for even one thorough article so must rely on memory often. I am often reviewing a point before I type it again in the sources below, however, even if I don't always mention it in the article to keep it concise and consistently styled, and focus on the state of current knowledge.

Often if I'm citing someone by name in an actual article (not here on this more generalized About page) it's more when I'm critiquing some of their reasoning (or lack of it where it should be in considering opposing logic before jumping to their conclusions), so people can know who to look up to see their own side of such cases.

## Recommended Sources

Some sources you can look at to likely learn much of what I know are:

### Bible (Obviously)

- The Bible. Seriously, it's vital that you do whole-Bible readthroughs.

  Search tools have their uses, but should ideally be reserved for things like trying to find again a passage you already remember from your readthrough, or such as using [Blue Letter Bible](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/1/1) or a similar tool's source-language word searches to see what isn't evident in a mere English translation about where else a word or related forms of the same root word are used.

  So often I see that sources who make an argument are showing apparent lack of awareness simply of passages in the Bible right from an English translation.

  That's not to say that the translations are guaranteed accurate, but rather that if you're going to present a view that seems to go against it, you should ideally show awareness of it at least, and preferably interact with it, showing legitimate evidence it doesn't mean what it might seem to. Though keep in mind they (and I) might not always have time to do so (and in many places online we're dealing with highly restrictive limits on how many words/characters we can use). But my point is that before forming your opinions you should have read the entire Bible at least twice.

  Also, don't do "read it in a year" things, at least not as your primary approach. It can be useful to do that as well, later, but first you should read it like you read any other pageturner.

  Don't rely on "memory verses", memory challenges, etc. Again, these can have value, but people often go awry thinking this is how you should prioritize your interaction with the Bible. This is almost completely foreign to how the original intended audience was expected to learn it, except that they did typically memorize it better than we often do, due to being an oral culture, which lent itself to better-practiced mental skills of memorization of long sections, or even entire works.

  Keep in mind no single verse, section, chapter, or even book of the Bible is meant to be read alone.
  
  Context is a major part of how biblical language worked; they typically had much smaller vocabularies than modern languages (with some areas of exceptions), with each word having often a wider range of meanings, selected for by contextual keys/cues/clues.

  Whenever I or anyone else cite just one verse, you should be reading back quite a ways and forward quite a ways around it, and carefully track the logic flow in the passages, and if your conscience prompts you to any possible meaning other than what you might have thought, research it. It may be the Holy Spirit, or even simply your own God-given conscience doing a good job.

  Also, ***NEVER*** take someone's word for it when they cite but do not show a Scriptural citation. Look it up. Every time, time allowing.

  Especially if someone is an opponent of the Bible.

  In my experience, they virtually always misinterpret, and often mis-cite, Scripture. It's shocking how often it is when you have a rule to always check.

  Even if someone is a Christian, if they're biblical, they, as I, want you to be doing this.

  I have been reluctantly forced to see where it's legitimately necessary to need to include only the quick citation (and ideally a link) when it's part of the logic flow of what I'm saying, and others sometimes do this appropriately too (though it's a lot rarer than I'd like), and you'll see this in my articles, especially in relevance/introduction/summary sections. How I advise reading such things is either splitscreen with the Bible on one side, or with a paper Bible or ideally another device with the BLB app or similar tool, and to help avoid losing track of what the person such as I was saying, just scroll back up and re-read once you have a better understanding of what they likely had in mind when they cited the passage, so you "receive" their communication of what they were trying to convey by the end of that. Yes, that can be a slow process. This is where written forms of communication really shine.

### Bible Websites, Apps

- In addition to [Blue Letter Bible](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/1/1), here are some other sites I use sometimes:

  - [BibleHub](https://biblehub.com/). Currently if you want to grab a large section of passages to copypaste without extra code or having to click a lot of buttons (as you will get from BLB), and it isn't so many that you might run into copyright problems, and you want a version other than the WEBP, this is probably the best site to go to. It also has a number of tools including for the source languages, and often comes up in google searches.

  - [Biblegateway.com](https://www.biblegateway.com/), which until recently I would recommend for raw copypasting over Biblehub, but Bible gateway's site and app have both recently turned into the annoying-ads-everywhere type of site. Still, if that doesn't bother you, the site is straightforward for simply reading a large number of English translations.

  There are undoubtedly other good sites and apps (often mentioned is the YouVersion app, but I've never tried it, so I don't know).
  
  Note that in the list of translations below I have some other major links you should check out, especially the NET link, which you won't find on my normal article pages usually, and LSB and WEBP, which you will.

### Recommended Bible Versions (Intro)

- A common question for those of us who only fluently know English is "which translation?"

  A somewhat poor answer often given is to rely on comparing many translations. That can be useful, but too many people think that should be your go-to option, paradoxically, in the days where virtually everybody can access tools like Blue Letter on their phones, in hand, anywhere (depending on service connectivity, etc.). Of course, BLB has a "Bibles" option in its list of tools too, as do most other such sites, in addition to the Interlinear. But your first recourse should be to the Interlinear, and try to study Hebrew and Greek as much as you can.

  Also, if you are anybody remotely related to making decisions about which languages are taught in a school you have any kind of control over, make sure Hebrew and then Greek are at the top of your list (and maybe Aramaic). I found in my own education that it was required that I take coursed in foreign languages, yet frustratingly these primary two languages of the Bible weren't available anywhere that I had access to.
  
  It should be considered scandalous that this isn't the case, generally, along with the scandal of how little education in logic and critical thinking can be found, even in self-described Christian education. Not to focus on the negative, but sometimes we tolerate extremely dangerous neglect in our society far too much. If an inspiring approach can instead be more effective, go for it.

  (For myself, I've gained a small amount of knowledge about those languages after the internet became more of an option after most of my education was complete, but this happened only after I no longer had as much freetime for such things, and couldn't afford to go deeper in debt to pay for a formal approach.)

  The good news is you can learn a lot simply by being often checking the interlinear of BLB, and focusing first on learning theoretical pronunciations of biblical-era Hebrew and Greek.

  I can usually slowly piece together how to pronounce some of the words there; they show the actual Hebrew (at the top for OT when you click a verse or as the default display if you click the Tools button) and Greek (top NT, bottom LXX), and the interlinear has their own transliteration system (although be warned it only currently shows the root form in website version -- and at one time the detailed in-between section of the interlinear also used to only show the source-language of the root form; that has been now fixed, but not the pronunciations).

  Be aware that BLB's website, if not logged in, defaults to KJV. It's best to save your favorite/bookmark links as to the first page of Genesis in your preferred translation.

  All translations that I'm aware of have some issues I've noticed, although I haven't kept extensive notes on the issues with them. This is true of all the translations I'll list below, so keep that in mind.

  #### Recommended Bible Versions (Main List)

    - New English Translation (NET), specifically at [this part](https://netbible.org/bible/Genesis+1) of their website. Read it full screen on a computer, and the right side should show their extensive scholarly translator's notes. I haven't yet had nearly as much time as I'd like to go through this, but this is a goldmine of insight into specific motivations of translators verse by verse, often not so easy to learn for other translations.
    
      I've seen a few cases where I'm aware of evidence they don't consider that their translation is at least questionable (though it's possible they were aware and had reasons they didn't mention to go the way they did), but often they give the specifics that strongly support a particular meaning.

    - [Legacy Standard Bible (LSV)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/1/1). Recommended recently (in 2024) by Answers in Genesis (by Ken Ham), now sold in paper form by AiG. Their translators have affirmed actual belief in a list of doctrines that translators of other versions unfortunately may include compromisers on. LSB is an attempted word-for-word translation.
    
      I haven't yet at time of writing this had time to fully read it, but I've been checking and using it extensively ever since KH's announcement and have so far found it generally better than others, including NET, although access to their reasoning is much more generalized than NET. [See their preface notes here (a must-read, and very easy to read)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/bibles/preface-to-the-legacy-standard-bible.cfm).

    - [World English Bible Public Domain (WEPB)](https://ebible.org/web/GEN01.htm). Unfortunately not available on BLB (don't confuse it with their Webster's Bible WEB). This is seemingly the best option for when you need to quote in written works or similar works from the Bible extensively, as it's intended for that purpose. Most other translations have required limits on how much you can quote them from.
    
      I agree with the WEBP's thinking on this, but it's understandable that workers want their wages, and that's biblically supported by Paul. In terms of the translation, I haven't noticed too much of the effect of "you get what you pay for" here, but since it isn't on BLB that's a major downside, and their navigation is comparably poor at time of writing. What flaws I have noticed seem to be as common in other translations including the ones listed above.

#### Other Bible Versions (List)

  Other translations that have useful value include, but are not limited to:

  - ESV (English Standard Version), described as word for word style, though you won't find as much clarity in the verses themselves on this as with LSB. Unfortunately, evidently at least one translator who worked on this is a known compromiser, from what I heard mentioned in passing (without explanation) in Ken Ham's announcement on the new LSB version. I don't know the details. In general, ESV is very good, though, and should be a go-to version from among the more populist translations.

  - NASB95 (New American Standard Bible 1995), the version LSB is based on. LSB made arguments against the NASB20 which made sense to me (from interview by Ken Ham on his YouTube channel; I haven't found further statements of that in text yet, but [this page](https://lsbible.org/origin/) does mention LSB works from the 95 version). I haven't personally read this much myself; I'm noting it more due to LSB's relationship to it.

  - NIV84 (New International Version), a very popular thought-for-thought translation in the 1990s. Unfortunately "NIV" without clarifications of which year-version had been plagued by scandal about potentially less faithful translations in more recent updated versions. The LSB and WEB both represent a commitment, so they say, to avoiding continued tampering with the aspects of the language that are motivated by language politics as opposed to genuine changes in the meanings of common English words.
  
    NIV84, though, is good for getting perhaps a somewhat more likely idea of what the meaning the author was trying to convey is, in a way that more naturally fits the modern English language. So it's worth reading this at least once in your life. Unfortunately it seems that BLB's NIV is a more recent version according to its [preface](https://www.blueletterbible.org/bibles/preface-to-the-new-international-version.cfm).
    
Again, there are many other versions. The above is more of what I have read and would recommend for various reasons and why, not intended to imply a recommendation against versions not on the lists. Over time I may expand the lists; we'll see.

### Vital Extrabiblical Sources (Modern)

#### Social Context, Scholarship Review

- [James Patrick (JP) Holding of Tektonics.org](https://tektonics.org/). I found him through his articles and mentions from CMI (of creation.com; read on). He has described himself as not a scholar, but perhaps an "informed researcher," and I've found an excellent focus on logic, and thorough research. He is a library scientist, specializing in proper methodology of use of sources.

  He focuses better than most on proper biblical interpretation in light of their cultural rules of use of language "onboard" in his own works, and has an excellent, must-read page of scholarly sources on this. If there is any single source every modern Christian who wants to pursue, as JPH calls it, discipleship, growing in the knowledge of our faith, of apologetics, etc., he's it.
  
  Due to my own limited storage space, I rely on e-books from his recommended list, but that's more than sufficient to gain a good understanding of how to understand the Bible correctly. Do note that one of the names at the top of the list should be taken with a lot of salt (note it's stated as recommended by someone else who works with JPH, keeping in mind JPH himself has written for CMI, although it isn't his primary focus, one of the main critic organizations of John Walton, the name in question (not of the TV show)). And reviewing the list, either some were added or (more likely) I only bought some of them, so I can only recommend some of the e-books on this list.

  Here is the [list](https://www.tektonics.org/books/socialbooks.php). Specifics I'd recommend as essentials (copypasting author/title lines from JPH's page here):
    - David deSilva, Honor, Patronage, Kinship and Purity
    - Bruce Malina and John Pilch, Handbook of Biblical Social Values
    - Bruce Malina and Richard Rohrbaugh, Social Science Commentary on the Synoptic Gospels
    - E. Randolph Richards and Richard James, Misreading Scripture With Individualist Eyes
  
  He also has many must-read e-books of his own, especially the Contextual Encyclopedia of Biblical Inerrancy, without thorough knowledge of which nobody today should ever be commenting on alleged Bible contradictions (unfortunately, I'm currently unable to find a link to this; I have the e-books, and JPH has a video promoting it, but the link there is dead, and google and Amazon both seem to know nothing about it, nor could I find more than a mention of it on his site, but much of the findings in it are scattered across his site's articles still), and other books ([Amazon page](https://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B00LS1AB36/allbooks?ingress=0&visitId=55661e6a-06af-41fa-98d2-c9675d49362c&ref_=ap_rdr), [page on his site](https://tektonics.org/pubs.php)). He has said that he relies heavily on many commentaries when he reads the Bible as well.
  
  His writing style is also often very concise and to the point (much better than my own as you may notice), and [his site's hub page](https://www.tektonics.org/menus.php) and search feature (top of page at his [site](https://www.tektonics.org/menus.php)) are very effective, so it's typically easy to find anything crucial that you need to know about aspects of the Bible that you may find a critic whining about, or majorly debated on some other topics. (Note the hub page has both a by-Bible-book section and a topical section.)
  
  He's also well-known for one of our most important sound supports of the resurrection of Christ, his [Impossible Faith](https://www.tektonics.org/lp/nowayjose.php) argument.

- Glenn Miller of ChristianThinkTank.com. He's the most often cited source by JPH, often going even more in-depth in extended analysis and quotes from scholarly sources. Many of JPH's crucial topics are rooted in GM's extensive analysis.

  Between JPH and GM, I've noticed that most who seem to find many passages mysterious or concerning display consistent lack of awareness of the data they highlight, or fail to logically connect the dots in the biblical way they do.

#### Genesis, Origins Science

- [Answers in Genesis (AiG)](https://answersingenesis.org/)
- [Creation Ministries International (CMI, of creation.com)](https://creation.com/)
- [Institute of Creation Research (ICR)](https://www.icr.org/)
- [Creation Research Society (CRS)](https://www.creationresearch.org/). AiG, CMI, and ICR are the main three sites I follow, but CRS is often cited for their journal. They offer a way to obtain access to and download all their journal volumes, which I did at one point, so I can check sources from them when cited by, for example, CMI.
- [Woodmorappe, Noah's Ark, a Feasibility Study](https://www.amazon.com/Noahs-Ark-Feasibility-John-Woodmorappe/dp/0932766412). Only available in paper, unfortunately. I try not to recommend such books, but this one is an essential for anybody wanting to comment on plausibility of Noah's Ark. CMI does have many free articles that summarize much of it, and it's noted that the book is somewhat out of date, but it goes through every major topic of ark feasibility and cites scientific sources backing it up, using a principle of generosity to the skeptic (such as running the calculations with the maximum possible interpretation of how many baramins were on the ark, showing that even then there's plenty of space left over, as one example).

  I have digital photos of every page of this book I can check if asked for specifics, although image-only so it's not exactly searchable, and I can't share them presumably for copyright reasons. As with CRS's journal it's an option I can check for details when needed, though not easily.

- [Dr. Russel Humphreys, Starlight and Time](https://www.amazon.com/Starlight-Time-Russell-Humphreys-ebook/dp/B003BVJCQI/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=), and all CMI articles following. The question of distant starlight is one of the only legitimately big "problems" remaining today, and his suggested (not self-endorsed per se) model in this book is foundational to why it is not a definite problem today, although we don't yet know which of several options is correct. And if they were all to be ruled out, we would not know whether another option not thought of yet would fit.

  On this I'd also recommend both AiG's and CMI's books of basic questions and answers (the titles escape me at the moment and out of time to try to find out), which list the current state of knowledge on this well.

  Dr. Humphreys also accurately predicted the magnetic field strength of Mercury based on a model from his interpretation of Genesis and Peter, making him one of the most credible scientists alive today (at time of writing). See also TalkOrigins entry in the list later here of sources NOT to recommend, for an incident that has made accurate representation of Humphreys a sort of litmus test of whether someone is really informed on the subject or not.

- [Dr. Nathaniel Jeanson]. Speaking of scientists with accurate testable predictions, Dr. Jeanson's work has been some of the most important and successful today. His books are a must-read (Replacing Darwin, and Traced). During 2020 Covid, his YouTube series on this with Ken Ham was extremely popular, and well worth it. I recommend watching it first, and then reading Replacing Darwin, then Traced.

- Dr. John Baumgardner. He has the current scientific model of the global Flood, generally most supported by mainstream creationists. I have focused on this and see it as reaching the level of proven beyond a level of reasonable doubt. Admittedly a somewhat lower level than some topics (much lower than the Bible itself for example), but very solid. Specifically I read the in-depth written debate between him and Michael Oard, who is okay on a lot of topics, but his Flood model doesn't seem to make nearly as much sense of the physical evidence as Baumgardner's.

  Speaking of Oard and Flood models, however, Oard's review of the rather strange model of Walt Brown should be read if you're interested in this topic. See also Standing for Truth below.

- [CreationWiki]() I don't know who maintains this, but if you can't find a topic related to origins on the other go-to sites, it's always worth checking here.

- [Standing for Truth]. A YouTube channel, primarily of a creationist named . See also [Young Earth Creation](https://www.youtube.com/@YoungEarthCreation), the owner of which seems to be affiliated with SFT.
- [Apologetics 101]

- Danny Faulkner

- Vocab Malone



### Other Extrabiblical Sources (Modern)

- [Hart, Experience of God]
- [Alien Incursion]
- [Strobel]
- [Mike Winger]
- [Nabeel Qureshi]
- [Christian Prince]
- [Anthony Rogers]
- [David Wood]
- [Whaddo You Meme??](https://www.youtube.com/@whaddoyoumeme). YouTube Channel. Very informed, evidently at least somewhat aware of JPH's work as he has cited it once that I've seen, and very good at parsing what people mean, as the title says. You might also recommend him from David Wood's spoof Islamicize Me. He focuses a lot on the core of the Christian message of salvation, and what it does and doesn't mean. Some of his older content seems to be the more "meaty," but he still puts out good content. Especially recommended is his takedown of the skeptic formerly known as CosmicSkeptic who had put together a 
- [GK Chesterton's Orthodoxy]
- The Behavior Panel (YouTube channel). Not exactly on-topic, and they seem to be standard Old-Earthers, but I follow them (although I haven't kept up as much lately, as their videos are typically very long), and the relevance of their top expertise in body language and similar topics is often indirectly relevant to pretty much any topic. The books written by them are worth a read too.

## Source to be wary of

Some on this list are extremely bad, others are generally good. Don't read too much into their being in the same list, for sake of brevity. Others on the recommended list above have issues too. Anybody with issues reaching at least a certain level of a sense that I can't just "recommend" them goes on this list, and some are on this list because you should definitely take everything they say with a whole salt shaker.

- Hugh Ross. Huge Errors. Sadly some Christians naive on the topic of origins recommend this highly problematic Old-Earther, but aside from many poor arguments such as treating poetic passages as "creation accounts," this is the guy who hired two people to write critiques of Dr. Humphreys, in which it was clear that they don't understand the distinction between a universe of matter with an edge and one without, despite this being crucial to understanding Humphreys' model that they were critiquing. Most critics of Humphreys rely on those sources uncritically.

  While it's possible he just made a mistake of signing off on something he didn't fact-check, since Ross himself didn't write it, AiG and CMI have documented many highly concerning behaviors, claims, and bad arguments used by Ross. Please don't recommend him.

- John Walton? Mentioning because this was the name at the top of the JPH social sources I mentioned above. I haven't read his works personally, but have read reviews and arguments against his credibility seem reasonable. Others have asked me about some of his reasoning which they passed onto me.

  Fundamentally, if they represented him correctly, he would be missing the biblical priority of physical symbols -- that is, things that do literally physically exist, which typically go with major covenants (and an Adamic original covenant of God's "if you do this, this is the result" statement is likely implied about not eating of the forbidden tree), and help serve as direct visual reminders to people of the time.
  
  This is likely the case of the two key trees in Eden -- real physical trees, serving as a symbolic way for God to tell Adam and Eve essentially, choose which future the tree of your descendants will have.
  
  Also the Hebrew for tree, erets, may be related to the word for earth/soil/land, ets (although it's spelled differently), or a play on words may be intended here, signifying that whatever they chose, the effects would literally apply to the whole of the Earth and its future inhabitants.
  
  The symbolic significance should be read as a materially-real focal point of simplifying the choice they had to make into one highly significant yet easily understandable command.

  Walton has become popular in certain circles, and his central idea, of a "Cosmic Temple," is something of a byword among Old-Earthers looking to reinterpret the Bible while blindly, uncritically trusting popular "science" of our current era (circa 2000 AD). I can't say much more beyond that without having read his book, but based on all of the above, I find this idea suspect. From what I can see of what else is represented about him online, he comes across as trying to promote a potentially deceptive approach of making revisionist Old-Eartherism appear to be the return to understanding the Bible on its own terms. As CMI/etc. have proven extensively, and as another name on my recommended list might say, "The precise opposite is the case!"

- Inspiring Philosophy. This is a popular self-described Christian apologist, going by that YouTube screenname. I have seen some from him that is somewhat decent, but tread carefully. I've also seen him shamefully attacking Answers in Genesis, claiming without evidence that the organization "lies" (!), and he promotes Walton and other questionable views. Also he stole the acronym IP that I want for IdealParable, my gmail handle. So. Yeah. (I'm not listing his name, which is known, although he uses it, because he did mention at one point that I happened to see, I forget where or why, that this became known because he was doxxed, and he hadn't wanted to be. To me that's a big deal, so I won't be passing it on.)

- Sean Finnegan
- "Rational" Wiki (and anything else by biblioskeptics)
- TalkOrigins
- ~ Sam Shamoun
- Erica "Gutsick Gibbons". Another source who was doxxed, and I know her last name as a result, but evidently she didn't want to reveal that, although she does reveal her first name intentionally, oddly, and has a bizarre practice of giving out her last name to some people as well without warning them not to tell others (she did this to a Dr. Buggs). Anyway, I was asked to review some of her endlessly spammy videos against a Dr. Tomkins of ICR, who is one of the main sources for the idea that human/chimp DNA similarity is probably somewhere in the 80s range (Buggs is as well). 
- Richard Dawkward. I mean Dawkins. Famous for intelligently designing a computer program hardcoding a target sequence of letters in from the start, and then somehow "thinking" it evidences anything other than special creation (or hoping his readers are extremely gullible), as well as actually conflating the fully infinite God with little-g-finite prospective gods, and basing actual arguments on their supposed equivalence, on topics anybody with a brain can see aren't equivalent.

- Dan Barking Mad Barker. Infamous for, aside from being associated with the financial bully organization, the Freedom From Freedom Foundation (or they say from Religion, but they try to take away your religious freedom; let's call them what they are), hilariously thinking that he found the "real" ten commandments, in Exodus 34, failing to read verse 1, which clearly says that the Lord would write the actual 10Cs on the replacement tablets, and thus misunderstanding verse 27's "write these words" as a command to Moses to write them as the "actual" ten commandments (the "don't boil a young goat" ones) on the stone tablets.

  It clearly says instead that Moses was to write these separately, not on stone, likely as application, *while* God wrote the 10Cs we were already told in Exodus 20. Barker was basing this on failing to understand Hebrew use of multiple consecutive pronouns for different referrents in verse 28 of chapter 34, projecting a popular modern English pseudo-rule against it onto Hebrew culture. If you just read the conversation between the LORD God and Adam in Genesis 3, you clearly see that Hebrew didn't have such a rule. Instead, it used context to specify which was which, and Exodus 34:1 is that context.

  For a while, this silly accusation made the rounds among populist skeptics, and might still show up, although I haven't seen it used in a whlie. I'm not sure if it actually originated from Mad Barker, but he's the most prominent source I'm aware of, that I had reviewed.

- Cult of Dusty

- "Dr. Josh" of some YouTube channel the name of which is escaping me at the moment. A low-level scholar focusing on often spurious accusations against the Bible on slavery. He "reviewed" Whaddo You Meme's videos on the topic, and had the audacity to refuse to even deal with WYM's central and most important point, that the Mosiac Law constantly urged fair and equal treatment of all, including foreigners, even though "Dr. Josh" had a premise against this as a basic core of his argument.

  He also literally claimed that the Law said that poor people shouldn't be around because God would miraculously make them rich, as if this was what the Bible meant, or even as if this would even be a problem (the passage in question said that there SHOULD not be poor among them if they all perfectly follow the law, which clearly they didn't, and it doesn't say this is due to any promise of miracles but due to good design of the law!).

  I also saw him on a show with some other skeptic of such ill repute as to not even bother naming (plus I forget the name now), and some other skeptic repeated the famously stupid argument of Cult of Dusty (see above), and Dr. Josh seemed to be awake and right there, and he didn't comment at all. He seemed to endorse it, incredibly. Many skeptics promote him as a reliable source. He's the opposite.
