# Flat Earth? Solid Sky?

**Bible Question:** Does the Bible teach a cosmology? Does it teach a flat world-Earth with a capital E? Does it teach a solid firmament (raqia / expanse)?

This subject is relevant to biblical apologetics and proper biblical interpretation (and simply attentiveness of readers). We'll see that passages and terms taken out of context don't support the FE (Flat Earth) worldview.

In some cases it's clear how a modern in a different culture might genuinely be confused. In other cases the attempted exegesis of Flatteners is very tortured.

Since both skeptics, who don't believe Earth is flat, and self-described Christians both claim it teaches a Flat-Earth (and some like Michael Heiser who are Christian and don't accept a FE in reality have argued for a version of accommodationism that claims the Bible does portray beliefs in it), we need a term for those who try to argue for the Bible teaching a Flat Earth.

I call them Flatteners (or Flatters for short).

This includes both views of a 2-D circular world-Earth and of a depthless sky-dome or sky-sphere (so flat sky in that sense; solid sky). Many geocentrists teach or have taught a spherical world-Earth under a depthless, solid sky-sphere. Passages claimed to teach both will be examined.

# Answer

Summary of results:

It's generally thought by Spherical Earthers (those of us who accept that world-Earth is an oblate spheroid) that the Bible doesn't teach a cosmology at all. It simply has higher priorities; the salvation message and the key history related to it.

Which by the way makes much more sense in the SE model; the Flat-Earthers, if consistent, would have to believe in a massive global deception involving wide-scale apparently miraculous power making Earth appear to be a sphere with a non-solid sky in several ways I'll also go over later. If this is true, it's strange even from their perspective when they think many passages to teach their cosmology piecemeal that there is no one section that talks about this massive world-deception. It seems to depict a deceptive God, or a much too powerful devil, or perhaps a much too-powerful evil humanity. None of that is biblical.

I do not see solid proof that it does teach a cosmology, so I think this is a good default answer.

However, there are at least two possible hints that it may imply a spherical Earth, that in Genesis 1 waters are gathered into one place (not a ring around land gathered in one place) in the original supercontinent / super-ocean setup, and one in Job that may depict a moving circular boundary of the day/night edge, which would describe a sphere.

It definitely doesn't teach a flat World-Earth.

And as regards a solid sky, it not only doesn't teach that the raqia / raqiya (expanse, sometimes mistranslated firmament) is a solid surface such as a dome, it forbids that meaning for the raqia since it teaches that birds fly in it according to Genesis 1.

If there is a solid sky in the view of the biblical authors, Flatteners must look to a different word or argument to try to support it.

Nor has any other attempt that I've found worked to that end.

I'll focus on the Bible first as that's generally my own focus, and the focus of this site. Sources are generally direct study in Blue Letter Bible (BLB) checking full biblical usage of terms to test assumptions that require the words to only have a limited range of meaning the Flattener wants (when I find they don't), and much of it I know because of JP Holding's (JPH) work on this (see end notes).

Dr. Danny Faulkner (DF), a scientist with Answers in Genesis, is also heavily relied on for scientific topics, and his views of biblical passages will be acknowledged where relevant. He does unfortunately seem not to know one of the key findings pointed out by JP Holding, especially what "earth" means. He may realize this but he skips over the explanation that uses this in several cases.

I'm going to start with that -- the meaning of earth -- and then start with the Flattener argument that uses it with Isaiah 40:22 and the one that uses it with Daniel 4.

## World-Earth Wasn't Named Earth Yet

"Earth" as in planet Earth, or world Earth for Flat-Earthers, wasn't named "Earth" in the biblical usage. This anachronistic error (confusing how language, in this case, was used in a different time) is one of the more understandable error. This fact isn't usually taught, so many people think they can just search for the word "earth" (lowercase e... unless starting a sentence etc.) and find the Bible's "cosmology" about the shape of world-Earth.

Unfortunately, they don't seem to notice the many cases that show it can mean dry land or a land, as in a nation, the land of Israel, the land of Babylon, etc.

Examples:

> <span class="bbq">/Genesis 1:9 God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear;” and it was so. 10 <b>God called the dry land “earth”</b>, and the gathering together of the waters he called “seas”. God saw that it was good./</span>
