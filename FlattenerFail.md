# Flat Earth? Solid Sky?

**Bible Question:** Does the Bible teach a cosmology? Does it teach a flat world-Earth with a capital E? Does it teach a solid firmament (raqia / expanse)?

This subject is relevant to biblical apologetics and proper biblical interpretation (and simply attentiveness of readers). We'll see that passages and terms taken out of context don't support the FE (Flat Earth) worldview.

In some cases it's clear how a modern in a different culture might genuinely be confused. In other cases the attempted exegesis of Flatteners is very tortured.

Since both skeptics, who don't believe Earth is flat, and self-described Christians both claim it teaches a Flat-Earth (and some who are Christian and don't accept a FE in reality have argued for a version of accommodationism that claims the Bible does portray beliefs in it), we need a term for those who try to argue for the Bible teaching a Flat Earth.

I call them Flatteners.

This includes both views of a 2-D circular world-Earth and of a depthless sky-dome or sky-sphere (so flat sky in that sense; solid sky). Many geocentrists teach or have taught a spherical world-Earth under a depthless, solid sky-sphere. Passages claimed to teach both will be examined.

This is an initial-findings article, although much of this is from study over many years before, but by that I mean I'll try to also track down any loose end I hadn't before, and use this page as notes of all the results. As such it may turn into an extremely long article, likely to be followed by a short version. If so it will be linked here.

# Answer

Summary of results:

It's generally thought by Spherical Earthers (those of us who accept that world-Earth is an oblate spheroid) that the Bible doesn't teach a cosmology at all. It simply has higher priorities; the salvation message and the key history related to it, and as it happens, cosmology was not one of the details it touched on among other lower priorities it does sometimes comment on.

Which by the way makes much more sense in the SE model; the Flat-Earthers, if consistent, would have to believe in a massive global deception involving wide-scale apparently miraculous power making Earth appear to be a sphere with a non-solid sky in several ways I'll also go over later. If this is true, it's strange even from their perspective when they think many passages to teach their cosmology piecemeal that there is no one section that talks about this massive world-deception. It seems to depict a deceptive God, or a much too powerful devil, or perhaps a much too-powerful evil humanity. None of that is biblical.

I do not see solid proof that it does teach a cosmology, so I think this is a good default answer.

However, there are at least two possible hints that it may imply a spherical Earth, that in Genesis 1 waters are gathered into one place (not a ring around land gathered in one place) in the original supercontinent / super-ocean setup, and one in Job that may depict a moving circular boundary of the day/night edge, which would describe a sphere. I would, though, caution against treating this as biblical proof of a spherical world-Earth.

It definitely doesn't teach a flat world-Earth.

And as regards a solid sky, it not only doesn't teach that the raqia / raqiya (expanse, sometimes mistranslated firmament) is a solid surface such as a dome, it forbids that meaning for the raqia since it teaches that birds fly in it according to Genesis 1.

If there is a solid sky in the view of the biblical authors, Flatteners must look to a different word or argument to try to support it.

Nor has any other attempt that I've found worked to that end.

I find that in every case, if we obey the Bible's command to test everything, to search the Scriptures to see if claims about them are really true, including claims from scholars and those who write manmade views of definitions, those pushing a Flat Earth reading of the Bible are never grounding it in sound logic from Scripture, but always have hidden manmade assumptions their reasoning rests on -- the usual error of eisegesis (reading man's ideas into the text, as opposed to the proper approach, exegesis; following the hermeneutical rules of the source languages to let the text tell us what it means).

I'll focus on the Bible first as that's generally my own focus, and the focus of this site. Sources are generally direct study in Blue Letter Bible (BLB) checking full biblical usage of terms to test assumptions that require the words to only have a limited range of meaning the Flattener wants (when I find they don't), and much of it I know because of JP Holding's (JPH) work on this (see end notes).

Dr. Danny Faulkner (DF), a scientist with Answers in Genesis, is also heavily relied on for scientific topics, and his views of biblical passages will be acknowledged where relevant. He does unfortunately seem not to know one of the key findings pointed out by JP Holding, especially what "earth" means. He may realize this but he skips over the explanation that uses this in several cases.

I'm going to start with that -- the meaning of earth -- and then start with the Flattener argument that uses it with Isaiah 40:22 and the one that uses it with Daniel 4.

## World-Earth Wasn't Named Earth Yet

"Earth" as in planet Earth, or world Earth for Flat-Earthers, wasn't named "Earth" in the biblical usage. This anachronistic error (confusing how language, in this case, was used in a different time) is one of the more understandable error. This fact isn't usually taught, so many people think they can just search for the word "earth" (lowercase e... unless starting a sentence etc.) and find the Bible's "cosmology" about the shape of world-Earth.

Unfortunately, they don't seem to notice the many cases that show it can mean dry land or a land, as in a nation, the land of Israel, the land of Babylon, etc.

Examples:

> <span class="bbq">/Genesis 1:9 God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear;” and it was so. 10 <b>God called the dry land “earth”</b>, and the gathering together of the waters he called “seas”. God saw that it was good./</span>

This directly states that it's only talking about dry land. Some argue that in verse 1:1 it does mean the planet, but this is incorrect as I'll show later.

The word is erets, pronounced in my Lingua (Ln) system (see end notes) as EH-rehts according to BLB.

It is Strong's H776. Here are the earliest examples where it gets narrowed to a land as opposed to dry land in general:

> <span class="bbq">/Gen 2:11 - The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one that [fn]went around the whole land<sup> H776</sup> of Havilah, where there is gold./</span>

> <span class="bbq">/Gen 2:12 - Now the gold of that land<sup> H776</sup> is good; the bdellium and the onyx stone are there./</span>

Those are copypasted from BLB LSB in that case from the example uses section of the erets page (go to any verse using "earth" in for example Genesis one at BlueLetterBible.org and click tools, or tap the verse depending on if you're accessing BLB through the website or its app etc., and in Interlinear click the link to H776 under erets / earth), with the Strong's number indicated.

In this case, if we were always to translate "erets" as earth to help show how the Hebrew really uses the word, we should be saying the "earth of Havilah" here.

Some might argue that English doesn't know this usage, but that's our fault for perpetuating a usage that doesn't. English has incorporated countless phrasings from the Bible, and if we were translating our Bibles more transparently, we would get the point in this case Especially because if you were momentarily confused, you would look around and see that "earth" is being used in verses nearby of soil (I'll show examples shortly). You might remember that words like "earthenware" do still preserve a sense of "earth" like this in English.

In fact, our planet (or world) is named after this!

Yes, you live on Planet Dirt.

(I'm not saying land is a mistranslation here; we just saw that the dry land is named earth. It's fine as long as every reader looks up the word, but vast numbers in English culture fail to do this, even today now that it's easy to do for free with BLB and similar online tools. Well, free after an internet and electric bill. But as you've seen, I'm also calling it land or a land in places here.)

Some other major examples where erets / earth refer to a specific region or nation or territory (all quoting LSB with Strong's H776 indicated):

Gen 4:16 - Then Cain went out from the presence of Yahweh and [fn]settled in the land H776 of [fn]Nod, east of Eden.

Gen 10:5 - From these the coastlands of the nations [fn]were separated into their lands H776, every one according to his tongue, according to their families, into their nations.

Gen 10:10 - The beginning of his kingdom was [fn]Babel and Erech and Accad and Calneh, in the land H776 of Shinar.

Gen 10:11 - From that land H776 he went out to Assyria and built Nineveh and Rehoboth-Ir and Calah,

Gen 10:20 - These are the sons of Ham, according to their families, according to their tongues, by their lands H776, by their nations.

(Read that as <span class="bbq">"by their earths"</span>.)

Gen 11:28 - And Haran died [fn]in the presence of Terah his father in the land H776 of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldeans.

Gen 12:5 - So Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot his brother’s son, and all their possessions which they had accumulated, and the [fn]persons which they had acquired in Haran, and they departed to go forth to the land H776 of Canaan; thus they came to the land H776 of Canaan.

Land (earth) of Canaan is repeated many times, not shown here. Go where I said in BLB to see all uses yourself.

Gen 12:7 - Then Yahweh appeared to Abram and said, “To your seed I will give this land H776.” So he built an altar there to Yahweh who had appeared to him.

Gen 13:10 - Then Lot lifted up his eyes and saw all the [fn]valley of the Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere—this was before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah—like the garden of Yahweh, like the land H776 of Egypt as you go to Zoar.

Gen 19:28 - and he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land H776 of the [fn]valley, and he saw, and behold, the smoke of the land H776 went up like the smoke of a [fn]furnace.

Gen 20:1 -
And Abraham journeyed from there toward the land H776 of the [fn]Negev and settled between Kadesh and Shur; then he sojourned in Gerar.

Gen 20:15 - And Abimelech said, “Behold, my land H776 is before you; [fn]settle wherever it is good in your sight.”

Gen 21:21 - And he [fn]lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land H776 of Egypt.

Gen 21:32 - So they cut a covenant at Beersheba; and Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, arose and returned to the land H776 of the Philistines.

Gen 24:7 - “Yahweh, the God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house and from the land H776 of my kin, and who spoke to me and who swore to me, saying, ‘To your seed I will give this land H776,’ He will send His angel before you, and you will take a wife for my son from there.

Gen 31:13 - ‘I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you made a vow to Me; now arise, [fn]leave this land H776, and return to the land H776 of your kin.’”

Gen 32:3 -
Then Jacob sent messengers before him to his brother Esau in the land H776 of Seir, the [fn]country of Edom.

Examples like this go on and on and on. LSB limits how many times I can quote it, and I'm not going to count them, so I'll just show a few more of the later key examples:

1Sa 13:19 -
Now no blacksmith could be found in all the land H776 of Israel, for the Philistines said, “Lest the Hebrews make [fn]swords or spears.”

Earth of Israel is extremely common once Canaan is renamed to that. It's generally in view by default when "earth" is used from then on, depending on context (or just ground in general, etc.).

One way you can see this easily in BLB is to search "land of Israel", and in the results, activate the checkbox for Strong's. It will show many other Strong's numbers for other words throughout the verses, but look specifically for H776.

[Here's a link to that search (this link might stop working if they change how their site works later though).](https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/search.cfm?Criteria=land+of+israel&t=LSB&ss=1#s=s_primary_0_1){:target="_blank"}

Be aware the count at the top isn't necessarily all erets. This is an English translation search. I haven't at time of writing this manually checked all 1,112 results.

By the way, in a browser, if your device gives you this option, on each page of those results you can use Control + F for a Find Search, in Windows, or whatever equivalent on other devices, and type  "land H776 of Israel" (without quotes), and it should highlight all cases of that per page.

I see the first example that doesn't count is Ezekiel 7:2. This is a "four corners" verse which is also one Flatteners use so I'll have a section about that later. For now the point is just that yes, not every find result within that 1,112 is "erets of Israel". The vast majority are, though, from reading on through all the pages (that took a while).

Some are also "land of Israel" with a different Strong's number, like in Ezekiel 7:2. (That one is H127, Hb adama Ln Ahd-ah-MAH, same as "ground" in Genesis 1:25" and related to the name Adam. Yes, Adam is named Dirt. (Different word for it than earth/erets.))

So, the exact phrase "erets of Israel" ("land H776 of Israel") by my count is only eleven uses. The majority of the rest of the uses have land and Israel in the same verse but not in that specific phrase.
