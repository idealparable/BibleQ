# Flat Earth? Solid Sky?

**Bible Question:** Does the Bible teach a cosmology? Does it teach a flat world-Earth with a capital E? Does it teach a solid firmament (raqia / expanse)?

This subject is relevant to biblical apologetics and proper biblical interpretation (and simply attentiveness of readers). We'll see that passages and terms taken out of context don't support the FE (Flat Earth) worldview.

In some cases it's clear how a modern in a different culture might genuinely be confused. In other cases the attempted exegesis of Flatteners is very tortured.

Since both skeptics, who don't believe Earth is flat, and self-described Christians both claim it teaches a Flat-Earth (and some who are Christian and don't accept a FE in reality have argued for a version of accommodationism that claims the Bible does portray beliefs in it), we need a term for those who try to argue for the Bible teaching a Flat Earth.

I call them Flatteners.

This includes both views of a 2-D circular world-Earth and of a depthless sky-dome or sky-sphere (so flat sky in that sense; solid sky). Many geocentrists teach or have taught a spherical world-Earth under a depthless, solid sky-sphere. Passages claimed to teach both will be examined.

This is an initial-findings article, although much of this is from study over many years before, but by that I mean I'll try to also track down any loose end I hadn't before, and use this page as notes of all the results. As such it may turn into an extremely long article, likely to be followed by a short version. If so it will be linked here.

# Answer

Summary of results:

It's generally thought by Spherical Earthers (those of us who accept that world-Earth is an oblate spheroid) that the Bible doesn't teach a cosmology at all. It simply has higher priorities; the salvation message and the key history related to it, and as it happens, cosmology was not one of the details it touched on among other lower priorities it does sometimes comment on.

Which by the way makes much more sense in the SE model; the Flat-Earthers, if consistent, would have to believe in a massive global deception involving wide-scale apparently miraculous power making Earth appear to be a sphere with a non-solid sky in several ways I'll also go over later. If this is true, it's strange even from their perspective when they think many passages to teach their cosmology piecemeal that there is no one section that talks about this massive world-deception. It seems to depict a deceptive God, or a much too powerful devil, or perhaps a much too-powerful evil humanity. None of that is biblical.

I do not see solid proof that it does teach a cosmology, so I think this is a good default answer.

However, there are at least two possible hints that it may imply a spherical Earth, that in Genesis 1 waters are gathered into one place (not a ring around land gathered in one place) in the original supercontinent / super-ocean setup, and one in Job that may depict a moving circular boundary of the day/night edge, which would describe a sphere. I would, though, caution against treating this as biblical proof of a spherical world-Earth.

It definitely doesn't teach a flat world-Earth.

And as regards a solid sky, it not only doesn't teach that the raqia / raqiya (expanse, sometimes mistranslated firmament) is a solid surface such as a dome, it forbids that meaning for the raqia since it teaches that birds fly in it according to Genesis 1.

If there is a solid sky in the view of the biblical authors, Flatteners must look to a different word or argument to try to support it.

Nor has any other attempt that I've found worked to that end.

I find that in every case, if we obey the Bible's command to test everything, to search the Scriptures to see if claims about them are really true, including claims from scholars and those who write manmade views of definitions, those pushing a Flat Earth reading of the Bible are never grounding it in sound logic from Scripture, but always have hidden manmade assumptions their reasoning rests on -- the usual error of eisegesis (reading man's ideas into the text, as opposed to the proper approach, exegesis; following the hermeneutical rules of the source languages to let the text tell us what it means).

I'll focus on the Bible first as that's generally my own focus, and the focus of this site. Sources are generally direct study in Blue Letter Bible (BLB) checking full biblical usage of terms to test assumptions that require the words to only have a limited range of meaning the Flattener wants (when I find they don't), and much of it I know because of JP Holding's (JPH) work on this (see end notes).

Dr. Danny Faulkner (DF), a scientist with Answers in Genesis, is also heavily relied on for scientific topics, and his views of biblical passages will be acknowledged where relevant. He does unfortunately seem not to know one of the key findings pointed out by JP Holding, especially what "earth" means. He may realize this but he skips over the explanation that uses this in several cases.

I'm going to start with that -- the meaning of earth -- and then start with the Flattener argument that uses it with Isaiah 40:22 and the one that uses it with Daniel 4.

## World-Earth Wasn't Named Earth Yet

"Earth" as in planet Earth, or world Earth for Flat-Earthers, wasn't named "Earth" in the biblical usage. This anachronistic error (confusing how language, in this case, was used in a different time) is one of the more understandable error. This fact isn't usually taught, so many people think they can just search for the word "earth" (lowercase e... unless starting a sentence etc.) and find the Bible's "cosmology" about the shape of world-Earth.

Unfortunately, they don't seem to notice the many cases that show it can mean dry land or a land, as in a nation, the land of Israel, the land of Babylon, etc.

Examples:

> <span class="bbq">/Genesis 1:9 God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear;” and it was so. 10 <b>God called the dry land “earth”</b>, and the gathering together of the waters he called “seas”. God saw that it was good./</span>

This directly states that it's only talking about dry land. Some argue that in verse 1:1 it does mean the planet, but this is incorrect as I'll show later.

The word is erets, pronounced in my Lingua (Ln) system (see end notes) as EH-rehts according to BLB.

It is Strong's H776. Here are the earliest examples where it gets narrowed to a land as opposed to dry land in general:

> <span class="bbq">/Gen 2:11 - The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one that [fn]went around the whole land<sup> H776</sup> of Havilah, where there is gold./</span>

> <span class="bbq">/Gen 2:12 - Now the gold of that land<sup> H776</sup> is good; the bdellium and the onyx stone are there./</span>

Those are copypasted from BLB LSB in that case from the example uses section of the erets page (go to any verse using "earth" in for example Genesis one at BlueLetterBible.org and click tools, or tap the verse depending on if you're accessing BLB through the website or its app etc., and in Interlinear click the link to H776 under erets / earth), with the Strong's number indicated.

In this case, if we were always to translate "erets" as earth to help show how the Hebrew really uses the word, we should be saying the "earth of Havilah" here.

Some might argue that English doesn't know this usage, but that's our fault for perpetuating a usage that doesn't. English has incorporated countless phrasings from the Bible, and if we were translating our Bibles more transparently, we would get the point in this case Especially because if you were momentarily confused, you would look around and see that "earth" is being used in verses nearby of soil (I'll show examples shortly). You might remember that words like "earthenware" do still preserve a sense of "earth" like this in English.

In fact, our planet (or world) is named after this!

Yes, you live on Planet Dirt.

(I'm not saying land is a mistranslation here; we just saw that the dry land is named earth. It's fine as long as every reader looks up the word, but vast numbers in English culture fail to do this, even today now that it's easy to do for free with BLB and similar online tools. Well, free after an internet and electric bill. But as you've seen, I'm also calling it land or a land in places here.)

Some other major examples where erets / earth refer to a specific region or nation or territory (all quoting LSB with Strong's H776 indicated):

Gen 4:16 - Then Cain went out from the presence of Yahweh and [fn]settled in the land H776 of [fn]Nod, east of Eden.

Gen 10:5 - From these the coastlands of the nations [fn]were separated into their lands H776, every one according to his tongue, according to their families, into their nations.

Gen 10:10 - The beginning of his kingdom was [fn]Babel and Erech and Accad and Calneh, in the land H776 of Shinar.

Gen 10:11 - From that land H776 he went out to Assyria and built Nineveh and Rehoboth-Ir and Calah,

Gen 10:20 - These are the sons of Ham, according to their families, according to their tongues, by their lands H776, by their nations.

(Read that as <span class="bbq">"by their earths"</span>.)

Gen 11:28 - And Haran died [fn]in the presence of Terah his father in the land H776 of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldeans.

Gen 12:5 - So Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot his brother’s son, and all their possessions which they had accumulated, and the [fn]persons which they had acquired in Haran, and they departed to go forth to the land H776 of Canaan; thus they came to the land H776 of Canaan.

Land (earth) of Canaan is repeated many times, not shown here. Go where I said in BLB to see all uses yourself.

Gen 12:7 - Then Yahweh appeared to Abram and said, “To your seed I will give this land H776.” So he built an altar there to Yahweh who had appeared to him.

Gen 13:10 - Then Lot lifted up his eyes and saw all the [fn]valley of the Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere—this was before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah—like the garden of Yahweh, like the land H776 of Egypt as you go to Zoar.

Gen 19:28 - and he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land H776 of the [fn]valley, and he saw, and behold, the smoke of the land H776 went up like the smoke of a [fn]furnace.

Gen 20:1 -
And Abraham journeyed from there toward the land H776 of the [fn]Negev and settled between Kadesh and Shur; then he sojourned in Gerar.

Gen 20:15 - And Abimelech said, “Behold, my land H776 is before you; [fn]settle wherever it is good in your sight.”

Gen 21:21 - And he [fn]lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land H776 of Egypt.

Gen 21:32 - So they cut a covenant at Beersheba; and Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, arose and returned to the land H776 of the Philistines.

Gen 24:7 - “Yahweh, the God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house and from the land H776 of my kin, and who spoke to me and who swore to me, saying, ‘To your seed I will give this land H776,’ He will send His angel before you, and you will take a wife for my son from there.

Gen 31:13 - ‘I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you made a vow to Me; now arise, [fn]leave this land H776, and return to the land H776 of your kin.’”

Gen 32:3 -
Then Jacob sent messengers before him to his brother Esau in the land H776 of Seir, the [fn]country of Edom.

Examples like this go on and on and on. LSB limits how many times I can quote it, and I'm not going to count them, so I'll just show a few more of the later key examples:

1Sa 13:19 -
Now no blacksmith could be found in all the land H776 of Israel, for the Philistines said, “Lest the Hebrews make [fn]swords or spears.”

Earth of Israel is extremely common once Canaan is renamed to that. It's generally in view by default when "earth" is used from then on, depending on context (or just ground in general, etc.).

One way you can see this easily in BLB is to search "land of Israel", and in the results, activate the checkbox for Strong's. It will show many other Strong's numbers for other words throughout the verses, but look specifically for H776.

[Here's a link to that search (this link might stop working if they change how their site works later though).](https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/search.cfm?Criteria=land+of+israel&t=LSB&ss=1#s=s_primary_0_1){:target="_blank"}

Be aware the count at the top isn't necessarily all erets. This is an English translation search. I haven't at time of writing this manually checked all 1,112 results.

By the way, in a browser, if your device gives you this option, on each page of those results you can use Control + F for a Find Search, in Windows, or whatever equivalent on other devices, and type  "land H776 of Israel" (without quotes), and it should highlight all cases of that per page.

I see the first example that doesn't count is Ezekiel 7:2. This is a "four corners" verse which is also one Flatteners use so I'll have a section about that later. For now the point is just that yes, not every find result within that 1,112 is "erets of Israel". The vast majority are, though, from reading on through all the pages (that took a while).

Some are also "land of Israel" with a different Strong's number, like in Ezekiel 7:2. (That one is H127, Hb adama Ln Ahd-ah-MAH, same as "ground" in Genesis 1:25" and related to the name Adam. Yes, Adam is named Dirt. (Different word for it than earth/erets.))

So, the exact phrase "erets of Israel" ("land H776 of Israel") by my count is only eleven uses. The majority of the rest of the uses have land and Israel in the same verse but not in that specific phrase.

Of the others, I'll try to count and list just the citations of the ones that I think count. But this article is, I know up front because I know this topic, going to be extremely extremely long, so I won't be quoting all of them. I'll skip ones that refer to the land of Israel as the land of Canaan even though they really are still the same basic thing in some cases. Ones that say it's the land Yahweh will give them, or has given them, are counted.

Exodus 32:13.

Leviticus 20:2; 23:10; 25:2.

Num 13:26.

That one's worth showing:

Num 13:26 - and went H1980 and came H935 to Moses H4872 and Aaron H175 and to all H3605 the congregation H5712 of the sons H1121 of Israel H3478 [fn]in the wilderness H4057 of Paran H6290, at Kadesh H6946; and they brought H7725 back H7725 word H1697 to them and to all H3605 the congregation H5712 and showed H7200 them the fruit H6529 of the land H776.

So, they went, and then brought back fruit of the earth. Does this mean they came from some other place that wasn't in world-Earth and brought back fruit from world-Earth? Clearly it means the scouts of the land that would become the land of Israel.

Cases like this are important as they tell us that the Bible can use "the earth" without qualification, and yet it still clearly refers to the land of Israel (or some other land depending on the context).

Thus, in cases where the context may be unclear, we can't leap to the assumption that it means all dry land. (Or especially to something it never means, world-Earth. But some of the FE arguments can work if it does refer to all dry land, like the Neb dream.)

Num 14:7 same, used twice.

15:2,18; 20:12,24; 27:12; 32:7;9,17,22; 34:13; probably 35:34; I think 36:2.

Deuteronomy 2:12; 3:18; 4:1; 6:3; 31:7,23; 32:52; I think 33:28.

Joshua 1:2; 2:2; 5:6;  I think 14:5; 18:3,10; 19:49,51.

Judges 2:6.

I think 2nd Samuel 19:9.

1st Kings 8:36. After that we have the Israel/Judah split. Instances of Judah or Israel will both be included. 14:24; 20:7.

Here we have an especially clear example:

2Ki 15:17 -
In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah king of Judah, Menahem son of Gadi became king over Israel and reigned ten years in Samaria.

2Ki 15:20 - Then Menahem H4505 exacted H3318 the money H3701 from Israel H3478, even from all H3605 the mighty H1368 men H1368 of valor H2428, from each H259 man H376 fifty H2572 [fn]shekels H8255 of silver H3701 to pay H5414 the king H4428 of Assyria H804. So the king H4428 of Assyria H804 returned H7725 and did not stay H5975 there H8033 in the land H776.

Imagine if our translations always said "earth" for erets!

The King of Assyria did not stay in the earth? If this means all dry land, does it mean he went out to sea? And don't get me started about world-Earth.

1st Chronicles 21:12; 28:8 (I think).

2nd Chronicles 6:27. Worth showing:

2Ch 6:27 - then listen H8085 in heaven H8064 and forgive H5545 the sin H2403 of Your slaves H5650 and of Your people H5971 Israel H3478; indeed H3588, teach H3384 them the good H2896 way H1870 in which H834 they should walk H1980. And give H5414 rain H4306 on Your land H776, which H834 You have given H5414 to Your people H5971 for an inheritance H5159.

That last sentence says give rain on your earth, which you have given to your people for an inheritance. We know the bounds of that earth. The earth is the Lord's -- all dry land belongs to him, all everything does, but here "Your" land/earth is more limited in scope.

20:7.

We're now up to Isaiah. No hits for that phrase equivalent in it (presumably looking for both land and Israel in the same verse).

Let's stop there. We now have the groundwork (so to speak), to look at one of the most-cited Flattener verses:

## Isaiah's Circle and a Sphere-Formation Army Surrounding a Camp?

w/Isaiah 40:22 It is he who sits above the circle of the earth,
and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers;
who stretches out the heavens like a curtain,
and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in,
23 who brings princes to nothing,
who makes the judges of the earth meaningless.
24 They are planted scarcely.
They are sown scarcely.
Their stock has scarcely taken root in the ground.
He merely blows on them, and they wither,
and the whirlwind takes them away as stubble./

I've seen Flatteners use this verse in four main ways.

First, they'll say that "earth" is planet Earth / world-Earth, and thus the meaning of circle, if it's a planet, would have to be sphere.

We've already seen that by default this is false.

Many Spherical Earthers who respond to Flattener use of this verse, however, are or behave as if they're unaware of it in their responses, and will accept the premise.

Then the Flatteners will argue that we need "circle" to mean sphere, and it's very common to add that if Isaiah had meant sphere, he would used the word "duwr" (which I'll spell dur; in Ln would be due'r), what they claim is the word that always means a sphere, instead of khug, which he did use here (Ln khue'g but I"ll just spell it khug).

The fourth argument works with the "tent" language about the heavens.

The problem with the dur (Strong's H1754) argument is instant when you look through the other uses. There are only three, and the second, also in Isaiah, is:

Isa 29:3 -
And I will camp against you [fn]encircling H1754 you,

And I will fortify siegeworks against you,

And I will raise up fortifications against you.

Clearly dur is a flat (irregular) circuit here.

The FE argument is that Isaiah "knew" the meaning of dur is always sphere, because he uses it in what's translated "ball" here:

Isa 22:18 -
And He will surely roll you tightly like a ball H1754,

To be cast into a vast country;

There you will die,

And there your glorious chariots will be,

You disgrace of your master’s house.’

Of course, this assumes this is translated correctly, but even if it is, Isaiah also clearly knew that dur can mean circle, or irregular circuit, since he used it that way.

So far the commonality is a tight surrounding, whether 2D or 3D.

The last usage is outside Isaiah, here:

Eze 24:5 -
“Take the choicest of the flock,

And also pile H1754 [fn]wood under [fn]the pot.

Make it seethe vigorously.

Also boil its bones in it.”

This one is pretty ambiguous, but it probably conveys that the wood under the pot is evenly distributed, with no gaps, and close to it so that the water that is boiled "seethes vigorously". So again, full surrounding or coverage, and closeness seem to be in view, and this is also clearly not a sphere.

What that means is, the only direct way to "know" that dur means a ball, from Scripture alone, is to read the meaning of "ball" into the very verse they're claiming is their argument! Two out of the three times it's used, it means a flat circle!

But it gets worse. From uses outside the Bible, Brown-Driver-Briggs says that it means cordon, related to Assyrian kuduru, which fits both the circular (not spherical) and tight surrounding sense.

It's also listed as from a root with a different Strong's number, H1752, but that would be pronounced the same and is listed as spelled the same in Hebrew, meaning to heap up, pile, or dwell, nothing about sphericity in the word.

However, this one is used only once, here:

Psa 84:10 -
For better is a day in Your courts than a thousand elsewhere.

I would choose to stand at the threshold of the house of my God
Than dwell H1752 in the tents of wickedness.

This has no sphericity connotation either, And Gesenius, which ironically some Flatteners treat as inerrant practically because it sometimes portrays their view as that of the biblical Hebrews, says means "to go around, to go in a circle."

Let's be real. If Isaiah had used dur, the very same Flat-Earthers would be insisting that dur is the word for circle, dismissing the "ball" case, focusing on the army and all of this, and saying it usually means a flat circle, therefore Earth is flat.

You know they would.

This is what they do with everything they can.

As for khug, I'll look at it, but keep in mind it's irrelevant if erets (earth) here means something like Israel or just one area of land, or even all land if "above" means "at higher altitude than" (not that God is only limited to a theophany that might be higher than).

Job 22:14 -
‘Clouds are a hiding place for Him, so that He cannot see;

And He walks on the [fn]vault H2329 of heaven.’

Instantly we have an intractable problem for Flat-Earthers.

In their model, clouds are not like a dome or a vault. Their arguments often use verses translated as "vault" of the sky to argue that it's a dome. Some have even used this very verse. But if khug (H2329) only means a flat circle, then this has to mean the "vault" of heaven is a flat circle too, not a dome shape.

The parallelism with clouds is probably in view here, though. Especially in Job, in the later chapters, we see that strong clouds have moved in, and God speaks out of a whirlwind (tornado). The speakers of Job often refer to things they're seeing around them as their object lessons for their figurative points.

Eliphaz here refers to stars, seemingly visible at the time, so this appears to be as the clouds were moving in.

Job 22:12 -
“Is not God in the height of heaven?

Look also at the [fn]distant stars, how high they are!

By the way, that is especially true in our cosmological model, but I disgress; the point is, he's explicitly using something they can see as his object lesson, and this is two verses before the clouds case, so he's clearly referring to actual clouds they can see.

Eliphaz is saying that God is walking on the clouds, not on a sky-dome far above it, consistent with God speaking through the whirlwind later, and very similar to the Lord being in the pillar of cloud in Exodus and so on.

He goes on to make it clear he's ascribing to Job the idea that God can't see through the clouds, but disagreeing with the idea.

Now, if I accept standard Flat-Earth methods of interpretation, of course, I must believe that clouds are solid, and flat circles.

Their model would indeed have clouds as flat, rather than ever wrapping around a globe, more or less.

But they want to say that the solidity in this verse applies NOT to clouds, but to the vault of stars etc. above it, so they would want vault of heaven to be a DIFFERENT thing:

Job 37:18 -
“Can you, with Him, spread out the skies,

Strong as a molten mirror?

So, Flat-Earthers must choose whether clouds are solid and flat, with the rest of the heavens being any other shape with no solidity connotation, or else it's the rest of the heavens, not clouds, which are solid and flat, ruining their dome model... or else khug can refer to a dome.

And if khug can refer to a dome, then it could also refer to two domes placed together; two hemispheres, a sphere.

Khug also has only three uses. The second is this:

Pro 8:27 -
“When He established the heavens, I was there,

When He marked out a circle H2329 on the face of the deep,

This is another Flatteners use in another capacity, but for now all we need to know is this is indeed talking about a 2D circle shape. The question is, how? How did God mark this circle? What is it?

Unchecked Copy BoxPro 8:25 -
“Before the mountains were settled,

Before the hills I was [fn]brought forth;

While He had not yet made the earth and the fields outside,

So the "circle" here (circuit) is the edge of LAND as it was raised; this is talking about the process of raiding up the lands, the 'earth' on which men would live. Before he had made the dry land, there was no bounds for the waters.

This works in the Spherical Earth model.

It doesn't work in the new Flat-Earth model; there is supposed to be the land border of Antarctica around the seas, and Day 3 is just supposed to be about raising up dry land inside that giant circular ocean. So that ocean is supposed to already have outer bounds.

So what this means is, khug isn't "circle" in the sense of having a radius in all directions equidistant from a center!

It just means a circuit -- ANY irregular circuit.

Remember that in Genesis 1, the waters were gathered into one place.

Parsimoniously this in turn means (aside from suggesting a spherical world-Earth since we then have a simple single super-ocean whereas the new FE model would have a ring-ocean around, an odd thing to call "one" place) that the lands were in one place too; a single giant supercontinent.

The way Hebrew uses "all"-language means that this doesn't imply there were no smaller islands necessarily, but that for the most part, there was one large landmass, so this earth had one single border of coast where it met the sea.

Although in Isaiah it's after the Flood, thus after the continents divided, so the seas aren't in only one place anymore, by default even if all dry land is implied, it would be the land Isaiah knows about, and he just knows that there is water around Israel in the Mediterranean, the Atlantic, and the Indian Oceans. He probably presumes that the land continues around something similar to what we know it does, the further north and east. He need not know about Australia or the Americas and their existence wouldn't contradict that God is over (again, possibly with a manifestation literally hovering over, but figuratively superior to) all the land connected to Eurasia-Africa.

This does have an irregular circuit around it.

And nothing about how wrapped around a globe it may be is denied here.

If anything, it's suggested by the "vault" translation of the other passage.

Also this seems to say that you can look at the waters as just as "centric" as the land if you want. That is, you can look at the waters as a single thing surrounded by land, as much as you can look at land as a single thing surrounded by water. This only works on the spherical model.

I'm again not saying it proves it, but it MAY suggest it.

And to be fair, again, since this is post-Flood, and we do know that there are three other continents, it wouldn't be quite that simple, but the Bible need not comment on that to be accurate here. The Pacific is much larger even today than the other oceans, so on a globe it's very easy to look at the waters as more bounded by land, as it is to look at the lands as more bounded by water.

The only other usage is the Isaiah "circle of the earth" passage itself.

This khug was H2329. Like dur, it also has a root spelled the same but with a different Strong's number, H2328.

And just like dur, this root only has one use:

Job 26:10 -
“He has marked H2328 a circle H2328 on the surface of the waters
At the boundary of light and darkness.

This is the other verse that MAY suggest a spherical world-Earth.

It's often suggested that all of these circles mean the horizon, and although that meaning isn't compatible with the Proverbs 8 usage we just saw (because it's the irregular circuit of the land in view there), and it could in a sense be argued here, but it may refer to the world-Earth's surface itself where the waters are lit on one side, and dark on the other. Since ancients knew this boundary moves toward the west, this describes only a sphere, if this root-khug means a circle.

A Flattener could still hope that they didn't know this boundary moves, but this would ascribe error to the Scriptures.

Keep in mind also that it's only the *old* FE model that had the edge of the world-Earth as the boundary of day and night.

This is incompatible with the new model where the sun never really sets, they just have light distortion miracles constantly in use (or magic or something) that conveniently makes the sky look identical to the sky around a spherical Earth, because their idea of God is evidently deceptive, or Satan is too powerful, or some such excuse. The new model also has a moving boundary of night and day, and it wouldn't be a circle.

Sometimes it would approach an oval, but during southern summer, when the Antarctic Circle area has no night, the new FE model has the day area stretched out into a wild shape that hits the entire border of their flat world-Earth, all of the Antarctica, yet misses places closer than the far end of it, in a shape something like a ring that's fat on one side.

Of course, the night side would approach a bounded oval-like shape in that case, so they could really complicate this interpretation by saying it just trades between a yin/yang like circle... ish... ish area of day and of night for somewhere approaching half and then half of the year.

Mhm.

Now, I've focused on the khug versus dur argument, the third of the four and by far their most favored argument, but what if we take that out? Can Flatteners still use Isaiah 40:22?

Well, let's go through the other arguments one at a time.
