([Skip to answer](#answer) if you're familiar with my standard "must read" notes below. Otherwise you must read the must-read notes.)

## Must-Read Notes:
**If you know my real name, do not tell others.** You may refer to me by my email address, <a href="mailto:idealparable@gmail.com"><b>idealparable@gmail.com</b></a>.

Bible quotes may be from [World English Bible Public domain version (WEBP)](https://ebible.org/web/GEN01.htm){:target="_blank"}, which allows quoting in any amount, or [Legacy Standard Bible (LSB)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/1/1){:target="_blank"} (links will usually be to LSB on Blue Letter Bible (BLB)).

**Bible quotes may be enclosed in slashes** without spaces (e.g. /In the beginning.../), preserving existing quote marks. Slashes with spaces may go between parallel quotes / fragments / cites / etc.

Extrabiblical quotes may be enclosed in "\|" (pipe) characters (example \|...the founder of the name...\|).

Keep in mind for brevity my wording may sound more definite than intended. This site is devoted to careful, open-minded truthseeking, building soundly from the ground up, and to helping anyone interested learn the current global state of knowledge. I'll try, though, to clarify what is less or more certain with clear word choice.

I might refer to a particular Bible question that a topic page is about as a "BibleQ" for short.

See [end notes](#end-notes) for more about citation style, copyright notices, explanations of common abbreviations, and a little more about (ideally not) citing me or contacting me. Read those too when you finish reading the rest of this page, please, if you haven't before.
