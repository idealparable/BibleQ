([Skip to answer](#answer) if you're familiar with my standard "must read" notes below. Otherwise you must read the must-read notes.)

## Must-Read Notes:
**If you know my real name, do not tell others.** You may refer to me by my email address, <a href="mailto:idealparable@gmail.com"><b>idealparable@gmail.com</b></a>.

Quotes from others may be in block quote format (examples below).

Bible quotes may be from [World English Bible Public domain version (WEBP)](https://ebible.org/web/GEN01.htm){:target="_blank"}, which allows quoting in any amount, or [Legacy Standard Bible (LSB)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/1/1){:target="_blank"} (links will usually be to LSB on Blue Letter Bible (BLB)).

**Bible quotes may be enclosed in slashes** without spaces inline with text (e.g. <span class="bbq">/In the beginning.../</span>), preserving existing quote marks, or in block quote format. They may (if I get around to it) be in lime-green font color. Example of biblical block quote:

> <span class="bbq">/In the beginning.../</span>

Slashes with spaces may go between parallel quotes / fragments / cites / etc.

Extrabiblical quotes may be enclosed in "\|" (pipe) characters (example <span class="ebq">\|...the founder of the name...\|</span>). Block quotes by default are in a reddish orange font color. I may (if I get around to it) format inline quotes of extrabiblical sources in reddish orange too. Extrabiblical block quote example:

> \|...the founder of the name...\|

Links are blue, or light teal for visited links. Most should open in a new tab automatically, unless linking to a location on the same page (such as from the table of contents), although the code for new tab has to be manually added; I might miss some.

Keep in mind for brevity my wording may sound more definite than intended. This site is devoted to careful, open-minded truthseeking, building soundly from the ground up, and to helping anyone interested learn the current global state of knowledge. I'll try, though, to clarify what is less or more certain with clear word choice.

I might refer to a particular Bible question that a topic page is about as a "BibleQ" for short.

If I quote LSB, I'll try to put anything that they put in italics into square brackets, indicating words not in original but, according to them, implied by the original. This is done by BLB automatically if I use the checkbox-select and then use the Copy button method, but I often just drag and manually copy.

"[fn]" (footnote markers) in LSB (and anything similar in WEBP) will be left intact in the copypaste.

When LSB puts an asterisk before a past-tense verb, which is their way to indicate it's really present-tense (as I understand it, -ing construction) in the original but where that would look weird in English, I'll preserve that in the copypaste but right after it try to add double square brackets, like [[this]] for the -ing version of the word.

As such for LSB quotes (if I remember and have time), you'll be able to read them both as what they mean according to them, and learn to read what they (evidently) mean into the awkward-in-English version, which may help understand the original better.

(WEBP unfortunately doesn't indicate these things. I might possibly, if the WEBP is close enough to the LSB, add in square brackets including double with -ing in WEBP if I think it's worth the effort per instance and it's clear which WEBP words equate to which LSB ones.)

See [end notes](#end-notes) for more about citation style, copyright notices, explanations of common abbreviations, and a little more about (ideally not) citing me or contacting me. Read those too when you finish reading the rest of this page, please, if you haven't before.
