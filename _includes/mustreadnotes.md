([Skip to answer](#answer) if you're familiar with my standard "must read" notes below. Otherwise you must read the must-read notes.)

## Must-Read Notes:
**If you know my real name, do not tell others.** You may refer to me by my email address, <a href="mailto:idealparable@gmail.com"><b>idealparable@gmail.com</b></a>.

Quotes from others may be in block quote format (examples below).

Bible quotes may be from [World English Bible Public domain version (WEBP)](https://ebible.org/web/GEN01.htm){:target="_blank"}, which allows quoting in any amount, or [Legacy Standard Bible (LSB)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/1/1){:target="_blank"} (links will usually be to LSB on Blue Letter Bible (BLB)).

**Bible quotes may be enclosed in slashes** without spaces inline with text (e.g. /In the beginning.../), preserving existing quote marks, or in block quote format. They may (if I get around to it) be in lime-green font color. Example of biblical block quote:

> <span class="bbq">/In the beginning.../</span>

Slashes with spaces may go between parallel quotes / fragments / cites / etc.

Extrabiblical quotes may be enclosed in "\|" (pipe) characters (example \|...the founder of the name...\|). Block quotes by default are in a reddish orange font color. I may (if I get around to it) format inline quotes of extrabiblical sources in reddish orange too. Extrabiblical block quote example:

> \|...the founder of the name...\|

Keep in mind for brevity my wording may sound more definite than intended. This site is devoted to careful, open-minded truthseeking, building soundly from the ground up, and to helping anyone interested learn the current global state of knowledge. I'll try, though, to clarify what is less or more certain with clear word choice.

I might refer to a particular Bible question that a topic page is about as a "BibleQ" for short.

See [end notes](#end-notes) for more about citation style, copyright notices, explanations of common abbreviations, and a little more about (ideally not) citing me or contacting me. Read those too when you finish reading the rest of this page, please, if you haven't before.
