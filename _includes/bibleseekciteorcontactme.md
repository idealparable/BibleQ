### Cite or Contact Me?
**If you know my real name, do not tell others.**

Please also think twice about citing me as if I was an authoritative source. I'm just a nobody layman with a brain who's dying (hopefully of old age), so I wanted to know what would happen after, and what I should do about it. As should all. I happened to learn a lot, including a layman focus on logic. So in case it would help people I try to make what I know available to others, but you should be doing your own study.

If you want to cite me, you can refer to me by my email: <a href="mailto:idealparable@gmail.com"><b>idealparable@gmail.com</b></a>.

If you have questions, be aware I might not be very responsive at that email. I don't like to spend much time on one-on-one answers as that only directly goes to one person at a time. We have a whole globe of billions of people to be informed. But you can try if you must. It's a Charlie Brown mailbox, though, and unlike him, I usually don't bother checking. Expect delays.
