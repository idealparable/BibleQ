# Did Lazarus Write John? Is he the Disciple Jesus Loved?

**Question(s):** It's been suggested that Lazarus is the one referred to as the disciple Jesus loved, commonly thought to be John, since messengers tell Jesus that the one he loves (not disciple he loves, note) is sick, and we're told this is Lazarus.

An obvious initial problem is that this disciple is said to be the author of the gospel of John, in the final chapter. So did Lazarus write John?

My answer below will be no, that's highly unlikely. As I understand it, arguments for Lazarus as the "Disciple Loved," or DiLoved as I'll call it for short, are making some important misunderstandings related (hopefully unintentionally) to some core doctrine (especially Trinity), apologetics (debunking countless Bible contradictions), and proper interpretation (how to know when "all" is literal).

I'll try to walk through major arguments pro/con with Scriptural quotes backing it up, and explain why I think John phrased things this way.

I could be wrong, now, but I don't think so.

# Answer
John and Lazarus were both very close friends of Jesus. It isn't surprising that John exclusively focuses on Lazarus in his gospel.

Final chapter of John makes it crystal clear the disciple in question is a fisherman (Lazarus doesn't seem to be), and is the author of the gospel, and the style of the gospel is very clearly the same as the author of the three epistles also attributed to the apostle John.

Ancient attestation is also unanimous that the names on the always-used scroll tags in every manuscript library, for all four gospels, are the authors of those gospels, contrary to populist pseudoscholarship claims of opponents in the current historical era (circa 2024 AD).

So we know far beyond a reasonable doubt that John authored the gospel by his name.

And other context makes it clear that (and why) John was referring to himself anonymously within the body text of his gospel.

In short, it was at least almost-definitely to follow an authorial avoidance strategy that Jesus pointed his closest disciples to, evidently, by his focus on "from the beginning" as an interpretive key, when in his Pre-Incarnate nature authored (I think, and will explain some of why below) Genesis 1-2:4, signing it in 2:4 as "the LORD God" (Yahweh God in LSB, WEBP) but avoiding mention of himself as the Person of the Son by that name within the body text of that initial account.

Much about that is highly disputed by others, and isn't the primary focus of this article but I've found their arguments extremely wanting, and I may cover it later.

And I think we can see where and why John likely started to place personal importance on the word "love" as reflected throughout his writing style in both the gospel and his epistles -- even in his very report of the messengers about Lazarus.

This is the mark of John's authorship and identity as the disciple Jesus loved (DiLoved)!

One of Jesus' statements in John's version of the chapter where the DiLoved phrase is first used looks like it's the reason this was impressed on John -- note, right after Peter asked him (if it's him) to ask Jesus who was the betrayer; that would psychologically "wake John up" to pay even closer attention to everything surrounding this event than even anyone else:

John 13:

/34  A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also love one another.

35  By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”/

John focuses on this -- if John is writing this gospel, as it seems crystal clear he did. Given the context, no wonder this impressed itself on him so strongly.

This would influence his common word choice.

Note that the DiLoved phrase is first used in this chapter, right at the part where Peter asks him to ask Jesus.

This is a clear physchological connection between the phrase and this crucial statement by Jesus. Remember that John wrote this later -- long after this statement would have impressed itself on John's memory and heavily affected his typical wording style.

Let's start to look at specific arguments and evidence.

## Don't Quote the Messenger

One error that may be being made by Laz=DiLoved proponents (arguments may vary, and I'm not assuming it's an error but hear me out) is based on seeing this passage as definitely *quoting* the messengers (the phrase in question I'll put in bold emphasis):

John 11:

/1 Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister, Martha. 2 It was that Mary who had anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.

3 The sisters therefore sent to him, saying, **“Lord, behold, he for whom you have great affection is sick.”**

4 But when Jesus heard it, he said, “This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that God’s Son may be glorified by it.” 5 Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus./

LSB has it as /"Lord, behold, **he whom You love** is sick."/

Quote marks didn't exist in Greek.

Usually these were paraphrases.

This is most likely *John's paraphrase* of the content of the messengers' message.

*Not* likely a direct quote.

Let's sum up this phrase "he whom you love" or its meaning, 'he whom Jesus loved' as **HeLoved**.

We know that "**HeLoved**" = Lazarus.

Does HeLoved = DiLoved? (DiscipleLoved?)

Note: This does mean that Jesus' statement in John 13 isn't necessarily quoted either. But it makes sense that John is passing on Jesus' statement on this. Jesus is paraphrased or potentially quoted as making similar statements in other gospels, such as this:

Matthew 22:

/37 Jesus said to him, “ ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’* 38  This is the first and great commandment.

39  A second likewise is this, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’* 40  The whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments.”/

See also Mark 12:30-31, Luke 1:27-28.

So this focus on the word love and relating it to commandments comes from Jesus most likely, not originating first with John, but John seems to have put his own personal style to it.

I'll try to walk through a lot of examples of similar wordings in John and 1/2/3 John later.

First, let's focus on most of the pro-Lazarus-as-DiLoved arguments that I've been able to find from some promoters online.

## Non-LiterALL

One argument that it has to be the same person is that the one called the disciple Jesus loved can't be John, or any of the "disciples" (see a problem already?) because Jesus and narrators of gospels say that all / each of the "disciples" scattered each to their own home, yet an anonymous disciple did follow Jesus, and helped Peter gain entrance to the courtyard of the high priest (I'll show the quote [later](#disciple-isnt-disciple)).

Example:

John 16:

/32  Behold, the time is coming, yes, and has now come, that **you will be scattered, <u><i>every</i></u>one to his own place, and you will leave me alone.** Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me./

First, although it's not my main point, how far do they need to be to qualify for "leave me alone"? I suggest they all scattered, and "left him alone," and perhaps eventually literally all went home separately (they may even have taken that part as instructions by that point), but in any case, my main argument allows for that this isn't literal.

The pro-Lazarus-as-DiLoved argument (which may vary) in this case appears to assume that "all" means literally all, in all cases -- or, perhaps, implies an argument that if it doesn't, we have a problem.

Not so, as I understand it.

## Say Again?

Hebrew "language culture" (how their culture used language, regardless of whether expressing their thoughts in Hebrew, Greek, or Aramaic or anything else) used *repetition* of "all" or synonyms to push toward a literal / universal all.

Notice in the verse I quoted above, Jesus only uses an "all" word once.

By default, this then should be seen as probably not absolute/literal, but that MOST of them would scatter and return to their homes.

It's true that we have more than one statement like this, but how close by do they need to be to indicate a literal-all?

(Or as I call it, a "literall".)

As we clearly see, "each to his own home" can't mean a literal all in this case (or at least not right away), at least not in any sense that would forbid this unnamed disciple from being John since John is one of the twelve, since Peter is also a disciple, by both the general definition and in the sense of one of the 12, and he also followed. In addition to this being said in John, it's said in Matthew too:

Matthew 26:

/56  But all this has happened that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.”

Then **all the disciples left him and fled.**

57 Those who had taken Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.

58 **But Peter followed him from a distance** to the court of the high priest, and entered in and sat with the officers, to see the end./

You can see here that by "all," Matthew clearly doesn't mean literally all.

If you didn't know before that Hebrew "language culture" has a non-literal-all, you should know it when you read this.

As we'll see [later](#disciple-isnt-disciple) from the gospel of John version of this, Peter and the "another disciple" in question are placed in parallel in terms of following Jesus, so this exception refers to two "disciples."

## Before You Flood Me With Objections

By contrast, we know for a standard example that "all" and synonyms are literal/absolute in the case of the extent of the Noahic Floodwaters by its over-over-over-repetition, including three direct synonyms of "all" (in bold below and underlined) and some other superlatives (italic and underlined) about the extent of the water (these will be all-capitalized), and many more about all land flesh dying outside the ark (I'll put the accumulating count for these in parentheses).

Genesis 6:

/13 God said to Noah, “I will bring an end to <u><b>all(1)</b></u> flesh, for the earth is filled with violence through them. Behold, I will destroy them and the earth.

...

17 I, even I, will bring the flood of waters on this earth, to destroy <u><b>all(2)</b></u> flesh having the breath of life from under the sky. <u><b>Every(3)</b></u>thing that is in the earth will die.

18 But I will establish my covenant with you. You shall come into the ship, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives with you. 19 Of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ship, to keep them alive with you. They shall be male and female./

(Keep in mind the listed exceptions don't change the otherwise universal nature of these statements, although that does mean they aren't literally all flesh under the sky dying. I'm not counting the "every" in 19 since that's about the exceptions. Also not counting the "alls" for Noah obeying, etc. Just about all flesh dying and the waters covering all land.)

7:

/4 In seven days, I will cause it to rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights. I will destroy <u><b>every(4)</b></u> living thing that I have made from the surface of the ground.”

...

17 The flood was forty days on the earth. The waters <u><i>INCREASED</i></u> and lifted up the ship, and it was lifted up above the earth. 18 The waters rose, and <u><i>INCREASED GREATLY,</i></u> on the earth; and the ship floated on the surface of the waters. 19 The waters rose <u><i>VERY</i></u> high on the earth./

Here LSB actually has /MORE and MORE/, which I confirmed in the interlinear just to be sure (מְאֹד מְאֹד, m\*OHD m\*OHD in my [Lingua](Lingua.md) transliteration system, with "\*" being the unstressed uh of schwa, mᵊ'ōḏ mᵊ'ōḏ in BLB's transliteration), so what WEBP makes look like just one for /VERY/ is two.

/<u><b>ALL</b></u> the high mountains that were under the <u><b>WHOLE</b></u> sky were covered.

20 The waters rose fifteen cubits† higher, and the mountains were covered. 21 <u><b>All(5)</b></u> flesh died that moved on the earth, including birds, livestock, animals, <u><b>every(6)</b></u> creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and <u><b>every(7)</b></u> man.

22 <u><b>All(8)</b></u> on the dry land, in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, died./

LSB here has another all:

/Gen 7:22 - <u><b>All(8)</b></u> in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life—of <u><b>all(9)</b></u> that was on the dry land—died./

Back to WEBP (reluctantly):

/23 <u><b>Every(10)</b></u> living thing was destroyed that was on the surface of the ground, including man, livestock, creeping things, and birds of the sky. They were destroyed from the earth. <u><b>Only(11)</b></u> Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ship. 24 The waters flooded the earth one hundred fifty days./

8:

/9 but the dove found no place to rest her foot, and she returned into the ship to him, for the waters were on the surface of the <u><b>WHOLE</b></u> earth. He put out his hand, and took her, and brought her to him into the ship./

That's a total of three "alls" for water extent on land/earth, with four additional superlatives.

And an astonishing eleven "alls" for land flesh dying.

If I can count. Which is often in question.

(Depending on how little or much you know about origins, this may be good or bad news for you.

As a biblical creationist, I can understand that many will find the idea of a nonliteral all concerning, but ironically, the answer to how we know when it's literal actually backs up biblical creation and its interpretation of a global Flood much more than you might realize if you don't know how Hebrew "all"-language works.

The idea that "all means all" sounds great to our modern English culture, and often it does mean a literal all, but 1) it comes out of the effect on our culture of the industrial revolution (along with much of our general sense that literal = good and allowing for nonliteral is bad, because as one of JPH's sources says, \|machines tolerate no imprecision\|) and 2) even we don't actually follow that rule, as <u><b>every</b></u>one knows, so it's inconsistent to impose a rule on Hebrew culture that even we don't follow.

Careful with that plank! You could poke an eye out!

Some object that literal=good, and thus the Bible should rightly be held to a higher standard, but this is missing that the idea that literal is better, or that nonliteral is unclear and open to interpretation, is part of our culture, not ancient culture.

It's certainly true that ancients could struggle with this (we're looking at you, disciples when Jesus talked about the yeast of the Pharisees), but of course, the fact that Jesus spoke even more figuratively than many should clue you in that the higher standard may actually be to make your language a little bit more interesting from time to time, rather than a snorefest.

For the Christian Old-Earthers who worry the Bible gets disproven if it teaches a global Flood and "young" Earth, because secular scientists claim science disproves those, those claims are debunked in excruciating detail by AiG, CMI, ICR, CRS, etc. (See [end notes](#end-notes) on those.) I'll be eventually including articles about that on this site to clarify why I say that from my own perspective.)

This approach to language allows the Hebrew system to communicate clearly in any language -- including English or any other translation.

This shouldn't surprise us as the all-knowing God chose this language as the one for his original largest chosen culture which preserved his message to all humanity, and the language for that message to primarily be in, for OT.

God obviously foreknew we would be translating it into every language we could.

This is also similar to the rule about parallelism as usually implying equivalence or some other close relationship. This is a structure we can see in translation, although some lower-priority structures do get lost a bit like the common plays on words in Hebrew.

You also have to look at the logic flow, and proximity to other passages that may repeat the "all," in each case.

For example, what about this one?

6:

/22 Thus Noah did. He did all that God commanded him./

Did he do only most of what God commanded?

Well, a few verses later we have:

7:

/5 Noah did everything that Yahweh commanded him./

He didn't necessarily need to repeat it, but he does.

Notice this is all still the same basic section, so we should read these as most likely modifying each other. We know that because of the logic flow in this case.

## Paul's All

Paul himself talked about this principle here:

1st Corinthians 15:

/27 For, “He put all things in subjection under his feet.”*

But when he says, “All things are put in subjection”, it is evident that he is excepted who subjected all things to him.

28 When all things have been subjected to him, then the Son will also himself be subjected to him who subjected all things to him, that God may be all in all./

## He Is Not Just Talking About Bread

Some of Jesus' statements on legitimate exceptions for "work" on the Sabbath likely also apply, especially what he said here:

Mark 2:

/23 He was going on the Sabbath day through the grain fields; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of grain.

24 The Pharisees said to him, “Behold, why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day?”

25 He said to them, “Did you never read what David did when he had need and was hungry—he, and those who were with him?

26  How he entered into God’s house at the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the show bread, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and gave also to those who were with him?”

27 He said to them, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. 28  Therefore the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.”/

This was referring to [1 Samuel 21:1-6](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/1sa/21/1).

For his own disciples in the present, this was probably at least partially about that he was instituting the new covenant predicted by Moses. (Details below.)

But about David, it's about how the implied "all" in all (all) didactic law (the legal genre that all all all ancient law was in, including the Law of Moses) isn't necessarily literal and depended on all (all) the other laws in it, in full full full context in the Mosaic Law, and would be determined on a case by case basis by the judges.

This is why the law was given, evidently, immediately after the setting up of the judge heirarchy. (See Exodus 18, where Jethro advises this, then 19 where the law begins to be revealed.)

The idea that exceptions always need to be explicitly spelled out up front is a modern one, so the objection is anachronistic. Social scientist Bruce Malina has documented this in detail (see for example his *Handbook of Biblical Social Values*, a must-read source recommended by JPH (see abbreviations list in end notes)).

For the part about Jesus' application to his disciples as Lord of the Sabbath, see here:

Deuteronomy 18:

/5 Yahweh your God will raise up to you a prophet from among you, of your brothers, like me. You shall listen to him. 16 This is according to all that you desired of Yahweh your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, “Let me not hear again Yahweh my God’s voice, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I not die.”

17 Yahweh said to me, “They have well said that which they have spoken. 18 I will raise them up a prophet from among their brothers, like you. I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him. 19 It shall happen, that whoever will not listen to my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him./

This was where Moses, passing on God's words, "spoke of" Jesus, as Jesus said he did.

That he was predicting a new covenant might be a bit subtle, but establishing a covenant was what Moses did (the Mosaic covenant) so that's implied in the "like me."

Also in the "listen to him." Basically this means when Christ came, it would be his prerogative to establish a new covenant, or not to, however God chose, and whether it would continue with the Mosaic one (as a branch off of it, as all previous covenants had been branches off of the previous (Adamic, Noahic, Abrahamic, then Mosaic), except arguably a replacement Adamic one when Adam and Eve sinned), or else replace it (as clearly it did, as a branch off of the Abrahamic, which the Mosaic also branched off of, which Paul makes clear in [Galatians 3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gal/3), especially verse 25 in context).

That it would indeed be a new covenant was explicitly confirmed here, as well as that it would not be a branch off of the Mosaic covenant:

Jeremiah 31:

/31 “Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah,

32 not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, which covenant of mine they broke, although I was a husband to them,” says Yahweh.

33 “But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days,” says Yahweh:

“I will put my law in their inward parts,

and I will write it in their heart.

I will be their God,
and they shall be my people.

34 They will no longer each teach his neighbor,
and every man teach his brother, saying, ‘Know Yahweh;’
for they will all know me,
from their least to their greatest,” says Yahweh,
“for I will forgive their iniquity,
and I will remember their sin no more.”/

By beginning to establish new rules for the ceremonial aspects of life like how to behave on the Sabbath, Jesus was hinting that he was the Christ, Son of God (as many other passages made it clear the Messiah would be God, beyond the scope of this article, but planned for others later). So he was initiating the New Covenant, after which the New Testament is named (Testament means Covenant).

Obviously, David was before this, so Jesus' point was not that Jesus was simply suspending the law as God beforehand, though he could do that too. His point is about how the law always worked, and this includes its "all" statements.

JPH has more material on this including historical evidence that this is how it was interpreted.

## Christ is the Creator, Not the Created

This rule about how "all"-language works in Hebrew language culture (including when expressed in Greek) is part of why we know Jesus had no beginning.

This is contary to a popular Unitarian view (of some variants I've seen, though some seem to vary on this) that Jesus was simply the first created being, otherwise very similar to the Trinitarian view but just as a lesser being, like a super-angel.

Since we're focusing on John here, let's start with the earliest example in that gospel:

John 1:

//

[WIP]

## Disciple isn't Disciple?

Another obvious problem with the "it can't be John because he's a disciple and all the disciples went home" argument is that, well, the phrase in question is the *disciple* Jesus loved.

This argument works from this passage:

John 18:

/12 So the detachment, the commanding officer, and the officers of the Jews seized Jesus and bound him, 13 and led him to Annas first, for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. 14 Now it was Caiaphas who advised the Jews that it was expedient that one man should perish for the people.

15 Simon Peter followed Jesus, as did another disciple.

Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest; 16 but Peter was standing at the door outside.

So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought in Peter./

This doesn't include the "loved" part, but it does include the anonymity, oddness of the anonymity (occasional references to various unnamed disciples aren't necessarily surprising, but this one is emphasized and the wording used a few times here), and, obviously, the word "disciple."

Parsimoniously, this is the same one referred to by the DiLoved phrase in the incident with the dipping of bread, and in the final chapter of John.

Now I find this argument *somewhat plausible,* because there can be two senses of "disciple."

A common error is thinking that one word always has one meaning only, or that if it doesn't it's a problem. No.

It *would* make sense to me that the "disciple" here (and perhaps the bread-dipping case, but not the final chapter of John) could be Lazarus. We see that the word can be used in a general sense of any follower of Christ, and Christian:

John 8:

/31 Jesus therefore said to those Jews who had believed him, “If you remain in my word, then you are truly my disciples./

The Bible often switches between senses of words. It was normal practice and a sign of a worthy wordsmith to switch between them in close proximity without spelling out that the meaning of the word was shifting, and rely on the intelligent reader to see the difference.

This was part of how the [wisdom teacher](RiddlesWise.md) would sort the fool from the wise student.

Like, I like the like count like I liked them all myself as the likeness of alike likers.

Here, it would be that when Jesus and narrators say "all disciples" scattered, they mean all among the 12 only, but that Lazarus can be a disciple in a more general sense.

That specific argument itself I have no problem with, so far as it alone goes, but it becomes a problem in these two ways beyond just itself:

First, when we simultaneously think that "all" disciples scattering rules out the 12, because we can't allow "all" to also have multiple senses. This is inconsistent reasoning.

Second, if we argue that this somehow implies this disciple can't be John.

If Lazarus can be the "disciple" who accompanied Peter (and, to be fair, he can in terms of whether he might have been there in Gethsemane; most likely it wasn't just the 12; I think Mark was the anonymous young man who fled in Mark, for example), and the one at the Last Supper (I'm less sure Lazarus can be this one at time of writing this paragraph), then he can be among the disciples told they would "all" scatter, and especially in Matthew would be among the ones near Peter who Matthew says "all" scattered, according to John 18:15 (quoted above).

So the argument, while valid, actually goes nowhere.

## Known to the high priest?

Another argument is that Lazarus is a better candidate than John to be known to the high priest (see passage quote in above section).

John was "just" a fisherman.

True, although to use this as an argument seems dubious; even if we grant for sake of argument that he's just as normal a mere fisherman as every other fisherman, and that this would mean that in that status alone, he can't be known to the high priest, why can't he become known to him in some sense later like knowing he's one of Jesus' inner circle?

But let's grant it all for now, for sake of argument. Caiphas is simply hopelessly uninformed, and he only knows Lazarus because connections and Lazarus lived nearby, we'll say.

Then there's a bit of a problem:

John 12:

/9 A large crowd therefore of the Jews learned that he was there; and they came, not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.

10 But the chief priests conspired to put Lazarus to death also, 11 because on account of him many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus./

Let's assume that Lazarus didnt flee Judea due to this, although I've heard it said that extrabiblical sources may claim or imply he did.

Even if not, he probably knew this, so would hardly risk going even within a guarded gate right to the very people trying to kill him.

It might be argued that whoever recorded this only found it out later, but the wording of "but" here seems to imply to me that it was known at the time and that Lazarus at least was trying to lay low.

That's also consistent with the type of culture they were, where everybody essentially told everybody everything about everybody all of the time. JPH's social science sources have much to say on this.

The Bible does record some cases of the general public knowing about intent to kill Jesus:

John 7:

/25 Therefore some of them of Jerusalem said, “Isn’t this he whom they seek to kill? 26 Behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the Christ?/

Although to be fair, they might have gotten that idea from Jesus himself:

John 7 (a few verses earlier):

/19  Didn’t Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me?”

20 The multitude answered, “You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?”/

Still, it looks like the author is saying that the people did know that they really were trying to kill them; that they already knew that before Jesus said that.

Earlier in the chapter, it was mentioned that Jesus knew this too, though of course he may have known that only through his omniscience. But in general it seems clear to me that this was common knowledge.

It's also possible for Jesus to warn Lazarus about the plot on his life too.

So regardless of whether Lazarus was known to the high priest, it seems highly unlikely that right during the arrest of Jesus himself, that Lazarus would risk going right to the same people who did that.

Far more likely it's a "lower target."

But Peter shows that he "feels the heat" (so to speak, in the cold, while trying to stay warm by the fire), so all the more, Lazarus would, when Peter denies Christ three times (specifically denies being a "disciple" of him, ironically, in John's wording in John 18:17,25, then denies being in Gethsemane in 26-27), as Christ foretold he would.

That this unnamed disciple who is known to the high priest is only mentioned in John (the gospel), and the identity of the fisherman DiLoved with the Last Supper DiLoved (read on) makes it clear that anonymity and the word "disciple" are the author's mark, and all the evidence that the author is John (again read on for deets), makes it highly likely that this is the author expressing his own perspective.

Note again how detailed it is about specifically who moved where when:

John 18:

/15 Simon Peter followed Jesus, as did another disciple.

Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest; 16 but Peter was standing at the door outside.

So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought in Peter.

17 Then the maid who kept the door said to Peter, “Are you also one of this man’s disciples?”

He said, “I am not.”

18 Now the servants and the officers were standing there, having made a fire of coals, for it was cold.

They were warming themselves.

Peter was with them, standing and warming himself./

And it goes on like this. This is clear authorial POV.

This unnamed disciple continues to be here -- he doesn't disappear -- and likely remains with Jesus the whole time, a little distant, likely literally so that Jesus is "alone" but such as at the back of the crowd in the "trials", or some of them (probably not with Pilate though, although specific reports of where Pilate walked are included, so probably nearby), and is then the one at the cross who is told that Mary, mother of Jesus, is now his mother to take care of, and he her son.

John 19:

/25 But standing by Jesus’ cross were his mother, his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.

26 Therefore when Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother, “Woman, behold, your son!”

27 Then he said to the disciple, “Behold, your mother!” From that hour, the disciple took her to his own home./

Note here that "the disciple whom he loved" is placed in parallel with "the disciple." That can be just normal shortening for the second reference, but it might also comment back on "the disciple" earlier who came with Peter to the courtyard, and this is almost certainly the same one here.

Since DiLoved is, again almost certainly, the apostle John per logic from the final chapter of the gospel, this is John. And so the disciple who was known to the high priest, Caiaphas, is John.

Why?

Why would Caiaphas know a fisherman?

Well, for a moment, let's drop our earlier for-sake-of-argument concession that somehow Caiaphas doesn't know who the inner circle of disciples are who are always there when this Jesus guy is being a thorn in his side. He could simply know that John has interest in what happens to Jesus. And that Nicodemus has no influence here, or any of the others like him.

Now let's pick up that odd concession we made, though.

In a worst-case scenario where the only explanation can be tied to John as he was before Jesus called him, a fisherman from Galilee, I still see several possibilities.

First, John and James were of a fisherman family. This makes it possible they were a somewhat successful one. Any success at all is possible to open up connections to elites like Caiaphas. The same idea is used to suggest how Lazarus might be known to him, although Lazarus lived much closer.

Second, we can't rule out a family connection without data to the contrary. Some uncle of John's might be a local synagogue leader who might have some connection to Caiphas, or to the Jerusalem leadership in general.

Third, what does "known to the high priest" mean specifically and how do we know?

Does it mean Caiaphas personally knew him?

Not necessarily, due to the cultural language rule of embedding.

## Embodying Embedding in Body

Embedding refers to the common linguistic practice of referring to everybody under a leader as if they are that leader.

We see embedding with the parallel passages about the centurion here:

Matthew 8:

/5 When he came into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking him for help, 6 saying, “Lord, my servant lies in the house paralyzed, grievously tormented.”

7 Jesus said to him, “I will come and heal him.”

8 The centurion answered, “Lord, I’m not worthy for you to come under my roof. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed. 9 For I am also a man under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and tell another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and tell my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”

10 When Jesus heard it, he marveled and said to those who followed, “Most certainly I tell you, I haven’t found so great a faith, not even in Israel. 11  I tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven, 12  but the children of the Kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”

13 Jesus said to the centurion, “Go your way. Let it be done for you as you have believed.” His servant was healed in that hour./

Matthew is condensing the details that don't matter as much for the sake of the audience, drawing their attention to the key aspects of this event, but Luke gives more directly literal detail:

Luke 7:

/1 After he had finished speaking in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum. 2 A certain centurion’s servant, who was dear to him, was sick and at the point of death.

3 When he heard about Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and save his servant.

4 When they came to Jesus, they begged him earnestly, saying, “He is worthy for you to do this for him, 5 for he loves our nation, and he built our synagogue for us.”

6 Jesus went with them.

When he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, “Lord, don’t trouble yourself, for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof. 7 Therefore I didn’t even think myself worthy to come to you; but say the word, and my servant will be healed.

8 For I also am a man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”

9 When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned and said to the multitude who followed him, “I tell you, I have not found such great faith, no, not in Israel.”

10 Those who were sent, returning to the house, found that the servant who had been sick was well./

(This is on the populist ignorant skeptics' lists of supposed Bible contradictions, of course. Embedding is the answer.)

Embedding would, in fact, be the default expected meaning people would expect is being implied even if nobody like Luke had ever let the rest of us in on the figure of speech.

This is likely one example of a difference in initial intended audience.

We have ancient testimony that Matthew wrote originally a "Hebrew" gospel (perhaps meaning writing in Aramaic, but it may have literally meant Hebrew), and that someone (maybe Matthew himself) later translated it to Greek. Matthew is also Hebrew himself, so he may have taken it more for granted how this figure works, while Luke is thought to have been more Hellenistic, so he may have had in mind more of writing for wider audiences.

Embedding is also seen here:

1st Corinthians 12:

/27 Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually./

And the previous verses starting at 12.

## A Man's Gotta Eat
Life works by you work for food. You farm, or you fish, or you hunt, or you gather, or you produce lab-grown meat that probably causes cancer.

Or else, you work in some kind of indirect support work for this, or for providing shelter, or amenities, or else you're an elite, and you work at some unrelated task, and those who obtain money (the "certificate that you served your fellow man") get their food from someone else -- whether directly from a food producer, or from a food distribution worker or workers.

If the idea is that a chief priest would not associate with a fisherman (which will be a problematic argument for saying DiLoved is Lazarus as it is, since the final chapter of John places DiLoved trying to fish all night with Peter etc.), or a farmer, or a hunter, or a gatherer... or a food distributor...

That may very well be so in the sense of Caiaphas himself, but once we understand embedding, we understand that servants of Caiaphas, of the temple, etc., provide him and the other elites with food.

Or else you very quickly would not have elites.

Notice again this wording:

John 18:

/16 but Peter was standing at the door outside. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought in Peter.

17 Then the maid who kept the door said to Peter, “Are you also one of this man’s disciples?”

He said, “I am not.”/

It seems like she who kept the door, a maid, knows this unnamed disciple.

I think the wording is more like that John arrived first (seems this is a thing about which of the two of them arrives first to places, as seen with who arrived first at the tomb), and told the maid that he had interest to know the outcome of what was happening concerning Jesus, because he was a disciple.

That would explain her word choice to Peter (read it just above again).

But if not, then it seems that she didn't need someone of higher authority to come back and say it was okay to let Peter in too; it seems like she knew the Unnamed Disciple should be allowed through the door and could be trusted to say who else should be allowed through.

This could simply be because someone who served food to Caiaphas knew John, or his father, or his brother, etc.

While they lived in very different places, that could easily happen.

It could also be that this is condensing that someone else did go and tell her that Unnamed Disciple's permission should stand, but this just shuffles around the same point. It would be normal in embedding too.

## Backwards Statistics Fallacy (or Error)

"Backwards Statistics" fallacy is my term for a type of error I see often but have struggled to find already listed on popular lists of fallacies, but it's closely related to a type of fallacy called fallacy of composition.

I typically refer to fallacies I've noticed but that aren't on popular lists as "errors" rather than fallacies when I don't have time to explain, to help imply that it's my own observation not to be found on others' lists, so keep that in mind, but it's a specific type of error that is fallacious.

While it's true that it's unlikely for Caiaphas to know any one *particular* fisherman, the argument that he thus can't known John is false. Statistically, when you consider the group of all fishermen, the opposite is the case; it's highly *likely* that every elite knows *someone* who isn't elite, and that includes non-elites from the fisherman category.

The only way to know *which* non-elites are known by the elites is reporting.

Given all the evidence showing that the "disciple" who Caiaphas knew was the author of the gospel of John, and (as we'll look at more later here), that author is John, we have the historical report that John is one of the non-elites who Caiaphas "knew" in some sense (or a servant of his did).

That should be enough for us; anything else is fallacious.

Let's delve into why.

In logic, we have something crucial called the Square of Opposition.

We have four types of corners to the Square:

1: "All" of some thing (let's call it S, for the subject of a sentence, as is standard) is some other thing (P for predicate of the sentence)

Any type of statement that can be legitimately paraphrased as "All S is P" (using S and P a bit like algebra variables, plugging in other things in place of them) is called an "A" type of premise.

My mnemonic for this is that "A affirms."

(S affirms P.)

(The four vowels used to label the square don't come from English words, so might be a bit counterintuitive other than the "All" case.)

2: No S is P = E-Type.

My mnemonic: E excludes.

(S excludes P.)

A and E (all and none; mnemonic affirms and excludes) are "universal" types of premises. Keep that term in mind; this is key here to why we have a fallacy with the argument that John "can't" be the disciple known to Caiaphas.

3: Some S is P = I-Type.

Mnemonic: I includes.

(S includes P.)

4: Some S is not P = O-Type.

Mnemonic: O outlies.

(S outlies P.)

I and O are "particular" types of premises.

If we affirm a particular premise, typically it is taken as confirming the real existence of at least one member. ("Some S is P" implies at least one member of S does exist.) While "all S is P" (A-type; affirms) is not taken as implying any S actually exist.

Our fallacy is arguing wrongly from O (Some S is not P) to E (No S is P.)

That is:

Some fishermen are not known to Caiaphas.

Therefore no fishermen are known to Caiaphas.

(And then, since John is a fisherman, therefore John is not known to Caiaphas. Ignore the problem that DiLoved spent a whole night fishing in John 21.)

Specifically it is a subtype of what I call "parts fallacy" -- the general category of fallacies that wrongly claim that what applies to a part of a whole applies to the whole, or vice versa. This subtype is which argues from a MOST to an ALL, or at least from a MOST to a LARGER MOST, without warrant.

Warrant could be if we had a statement where Caiaphas is on record saying, "I know no fishermen, and none of my servants know any either."

(Of course, that also doesn't disprove John, since we don't actually agree that it doesn't mean that Caiaphas, or she who governs the door, or anybody else knows John is a disciple of Jesus, so had interest to be let in for Jesus' trial. Plus Caiaphas could be lying, or using hyperbole, but it would at least be evidence pushing against John.)

Here's the list of main examples I see a lot or otherwise are important main categories to understand the types of "parts fallacies:"

- **Parts fallacy:** My term for both the fallacies of composition and division. (Arguing from particular to universal or from universal to particular, or any combination of those, including from particular to majority, minority to majority, majority to minority, etc.)
- **Composition fallacy:** "Something true of a part is true of the whole." (Particular to universal. Backwards Statistics would be a subtype of this, as are the others below other than Division. This can include positive (some, to all) or negative (some not, to none).)

- **Division fallacy:** "Something true of a whole is true of a part." (Universal to particular.)

- **Hasty Generalization:** "One, or a few, cases, prove a majority, or a universal." Also *Anecdotal evidence* or *Faulty Generalization.* (One or a few, to most or all.) I call it **HastyGen** for short.

- **Overconfident Extrapolation:** "A pattern found in most cases with limited data, will (or will most likely) apply to other cases." (Pattern in one or a few, to pattern in most of all.)

- **Overgeneralization:** Whereas HastyGen argues from a potential minority to a majority or universal, overgeneralization argues from a majority to a higher majority (such as a vast majority) or to a universal. (More, to most or all.)

  This one is essentially Backwards Statistics, but Backwards Statistics has a slightly different emphasis that's more relevant to why overgeneralization is wrong and shows that the specific type of use of it is actually self-refuting.
  
  Overgeneralization can be plausible evidentially as a likelihood argument, but is fallacious if it's treated as a guarantee, and even likelihood arguments can push to far.

  The reason I like to have a specific term for the self-refuting type of overgeneralization is that if you just reply to the use of the self-refuting type with "that's an overgeneralization," people will emotionally (often) assume it's a weak response to a strong argument they made, while acknowledging that their argument isn't absolutely proven.

  The precise opposite is the case when it's the specific type of overgeneralization I'm talking about; they made an extremely weak argument, and it's best for the reply to make that initially very clear (politely if you can manage that).

- **Backwards Statistics Error** (or Fallacy, but it's my term so you won't find this on populist fallacy lists... currently... most likely... as of 2024...). This is when someone makes an argument, the truth of which is itself highly unlikely, because some aspect of the argument is rightly identifying something highly unlikely, so self-refuting overgeneralization.

  That is, in order for their argument to be accepted as true, once we properly understand the situation, we must admit that the argument is false.

  Namely, the premise that the argument requires, that we should not treat as the default, most-likely true view, something which goes against the statistical norm.

  In this Caiaphas case, we can accept that it is indeed unlikely that Caiaphas knew the particular fisherman named John, in and of only his status as fisherman.

  But we can't accept that the disciple known to Caiaphas "can't" be John simply because John is a fisherman, even if we grant that Caiaphas could only known him from his life prior to Jesus calling him, so back when he was just a random fisherman.

  Because to accept that, we must accept that Caiaphas is the rare type of person who has no connections to any non-elite.
  
  While that becomes slightly less highly unlikely for the elite-of-elites, it's still highly unlikely.

  Since these cancel out, we really just have no default either way here, and we simply look to the evidence, and see that the evidence itself makes it most likely that it's John who is known to Caiaphas.

  You could also call this **Self-refuting Overgeneralization.**

Just to be crystal clear and thorough, Caiaphas lying about not knowing any non-elites, or specifically any fishermen, and Caiaphas using hyperbole, are both default expectations highly likely in their culture, especially hyperbole.

For the lying, this is so at least if we take the biblical data seriously about how the typical leader of the group he seems to have been part of (so not including Nicodemus for example), in that they don't seem concerned primarily with truth but with which words will play best politically for them.

In other words, we would expect that most likely he's a lying politician.

In any event, as far as we know, we have no such statement by Caiaphas. We need one to remove the unlikeliness that Caiaphas doesn't know any fishermen.

So we have three unlikelihoods being swept under the rug to argue based on the admittely legitimate unlikelihood that Caiaphas knows a particular fisherman named John.

Two of them are in an opposite category based on whether we have a statement to the effect of the first.

The first is "Caiaphas doesn't know *any* fishermen."

Absent a statement, we can't really ascertain how likely this is. We only know that most likely he *does* know many non-elites, that most likely he knows some non-elites from Galilee, and that most likely some of those non-elites have a variety of jobs, some of which include fishermen.

We know from this that while the specific job of fisherman is somewhat unlikely to be among the jobs of the non-elite Galileans Caiaphas most likely knows, we certainly can't rule it out.

What use is being a Galilean if you don't relate very likely to eating, distributing, or fishing for, fish?

He at least knows people, almost certainly, who know a fisherman or a distributor of fish from Galilee, because this likely someone who Caiaphas probably knows, likely eats fish, because he or she is a Galilean.

So Caiaphas is *most likely* only *one* step removed from knowing a fisherman or fish-distributor of Galilee!

Looking a little less astronomically unlikely now that he might just know a fisherman, huh?

Now it still *is* unlikely -- let's not commit Backwards Statistics ourselves. But not at all impossible.

If we get a statement, we can ignore the above problems, and just say that most likely Caiaphas indeed didn't know a fisherman from Galilee, but we still have the two other unlikelihoods to deal with:

First, it's unlikely he is always honest.

We would be accepting that most likely the statement is honest in his case (depending on other evidence), but only because it was already unlikely that the high priest knows a fisherman of Galilee, which we accepted from the start.

Second, that even if it's honest, it isn't essentially hyperbole.

The norm in their culture is what we would typically lump in with hyperbole.

Although for us, the connotation of hyperbole is a bit different from how they normally use as-if-universal statements.

For them the phrasing that looks absolute to us is simply their way of telling people of at least a majority.

Also for us, over-repetition might look like "he doth protest too much," but for them that was simply how they clarified they meant it literally. Which is a much more sensible and less guess-prone type of society, let's be honest.

Many moderns would react poorly to the length of this article in a similar way for example, but the only alternative they promote is then a return to wallowing in uncertainty on this topic. Why must we moderns be always stuck in uncertainty?

It would be almost fine if so many of us weren't so hand-wringey about whenever we encounter uncertainty.

We create our own problem.

And the topic might seem irrelevant at first, but I happened to have focused on more obviously relevant topics for a long time enough to know instantly some key ones it does touch on (mentioned briefly in intro; I'll explain later below).

In any case, I find that most likely, following what we could call the Columbo rule, most likely the way we'll answer questions is by a thorough investigation, and most likely, some things that might seem trivial will turn out not to be, and the only way to be sure is to check.

It's great to prioritize the most obvious relevances; at this point in 2024 I've done that a lot and it frankly gets boring to rehash it all.

This seemingly trivial topic happens to touch on a lot of them, so I saw an opportunity for an interesting diversion that might help motivate lazy me to actually start putting together this site with collections of the evidence and logic, so I'm using this article as a sort of groundwork or springboard. And I can recycle bits of it for other articles such as on the Trinity.

Admittedly, I should learn to stop being lazy and have robot-like switchable motivation, though, all of the time.

(That was hyperbole.)

Now, I could at least accept that Caiaphas probably remembers clearly whether he knows of any fishermen though, such that he would personally approve them entering the gate. (He might forget having met any, but that's irrelevant.)

Although it would also be unlikely he was even personally consulted for that, since he might have been a bit busy at the time, depending on where he was when the arresting group arrived with Jesus related to where Unnamed Disciple was.

## Rabbit: Fishy

[Update after draft: Okay this section became so long even for me it feels a bit cruel to just toss the reader into it. I do recommend reading all of it; this is how you follow a trail of evidence wherever it leads, thoroughly. But if you want to skip to its conclusion, click here: [Skip Rabbit: Fishy](#skip-rabbit-fishy). We've got weightier meat still to get to so... either way make sure you don't abandon this hopelessly long article (sorry for that).]

Let's look at the final chapter of John now, and see why it seems fishy to argue that the Unnamed Disciple who let Peter in can't be John because John as a fisherman can't know Caiaphas.

That is that the DiLoved seems to be a fisherman.

Here, we're *granting* the backwards statistics error, for sake of argument, just to see what would happen.

After all, the fact that it's an error of likelihoods doesn't rule out that Caiaphas and all his servants might indeed not know any fishermen. We still granted that this is in fact default (unless high priests knowing fishermen of Galilee was normal, but I don't know of evidence for that).

So now we're saying that Caiaphas essentially can't know fishermen.

And we're wondering if there's evidence DiLoved is a fisherman.

Such that if one of the people called DiLoved is Lazarus, there would have to be multiple people given that "the disciple Jesus loved" appellation in the gospel of John, and it can't be the one in the final chapter, if that one is a fisherman.

And as we'll see, it then also couldn't be the one the first time the phrase is used, at the Last Supper.

On the premise of fisherman-association-free Caiaphas.

(And as shown earlier above, the DiLoved seems to be the Unnamed Disciple.)

At the end of the chapter we'll also see that DiLoved is (very strongly apparently) the author of the gospel of John.

John 21:

/1 After these things, Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias. He revealed himself this way.

2 Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus,† Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together. 3 Simon Peter said to them, “I’m going fishing.”

They told him, “We are also coming with you.” They immediately went out and entered into the boat./

Let's pause for now.

We know that three of these names are fishermen -- Peter and the sons of Zebedee. It's possible non-fishermen still could help out, so keep that in mind about the "two others." Offhand I don't know about Thomas Didymus or Nathanael of Cana, but the latter is at least of Galilee.

Before looking into them, let's just put the passages that confirm about Peter (as obvious as that seems) and the sons of Zebedee, and who they were:

Mark 1:

/16 Passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.

17 Jesus said to them, “Come after me, and I will make you into fishers for men.”

18 Immediately they left their nets, and followed him.

19 Going on a little further from there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets.

20 Immediately he called them, and they left their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him./

See also Matthew 4:18-22, very similar to Mark, and:

### A Long Luke Passage I Quoted

Luke 5:

/2 He saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets. 3 He entered into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat.

4 When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.”

5 Simon answered him, “Master, we worked all night and caught nothing; but at your word I will let down the net.”

6 When they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net was breaking.

7 They beckoned to their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them. They came and filled both boats, so that they began to sink.

8 But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord.”

9 For he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they had caught; 10 and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon.

Jesus said to Simon, “Don’t be afraid. From now on you will be catching people alive.”

11 When they had brought their boats to land, they left everything, and followed him./

I hope you read that closely. Read it one more time. Now, having returned here, read it one more time.

Got it?

Notice anything familiar? Well, you'll see when we continue in John 21.

Now, I don't know the professions of Thomas or Nathanael. I haven't studied this enough to know whether that's the current global state of knowledge though. I'll grant that Nathanael need not be a fisherman for it to be obviously plausible that he would automatically want to go fishing. It's said that he might be the Bartholomew mentioned in the synoptics, I don't know why at time of writing.

On the way to introducing Nathanael, let's cover some John 1 content.

After the intro about the Word/Light, we're told a lot about John.

John the Baptist, that is.

The fact that John the Baptist (Bap) is simply referred to as John, often, is probably evidence for identifying the apostle John as the author of the gospel by that name for two reasons.

First that it implies the apostle John is less likely than others to feel the need to think of Bap by a more clarified name habitually. He know who he is, and while the name John is a common name, for him he would be used to simply referring to the Baptist as simply John.

I saw this at a place I worked who had two people with the same name, and two other people with a different same name. They would simply refer to each other by their own names, when referring to the other who had the same first name. The rest of us had to constantly have ways to clarify which ones we meant.

Second, people named John tend to take note of other people named John.

We see also that the gospel of John is the only one who tells us the name of the father of Peter (that's in John 21 later so we'll get there). That name is John; the apostle Peter is Peter son of John (not, presumably, John the Baptist, and not the apostle John considering that would make the apostle already very old and it's thought that he lived longer than any of the others of the 12).

It seems like the author of the gospel of John might be someone named "John."

It's just a guess.

(That was reverse hyperbole.)

Next, let's have you [scroll up and re-read the long Luke passage I had quoted](##a-long-luke-passage-i-quoted).

Then return here and keep reading.

No particular reason just yet. I just felt like it. That was reverse hyperbole.

John 1:

/14 The Word became flesh and lived among us. We saw his glory, such glory as of the only born‡ Son of the Father, full of grace and truth. 15 John testified about him. He cried out, saying, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me has surpassed me, for he was before me.’ ” 16 From his fullness we all received grace upon grace. 17 For the law was given through Moses. Grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ./

This reads as a summary of the entire book, and we're shortly going to see more context of when and where John (Bap) said this. The implication is that the "we" includes one person who saw all of this. Could that be Lazarus? I don't know, but it sure can be John son of Zebedee!

I suggest that what we're about to read is from John "Zebson's" POV.

Continuing in John 1 until otherwise noted.

/18 No one has seen God at any time. The only born† Son,‡ who is in the bosom of the Father, has declared him.

19 This is John’s testimony, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”

20 He declared, and didn’t deny, but he declared, “I am not the Christ.”

21 They asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?”

He said, “I am not.”

“Are you the prophet?”

He answered, “No.”

22 They said therefore to him, “Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”

23 He said, “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’* as Isaiah the prophet said.”

24 The ones who had been sent were from the Pharisees. 25 They asked him, “Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?”

26 John answered them, “I baptize in water, but among you stands one whom you don’t know. 27 He is the one who comes after me, who is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I’m not worthy to loosen.” 28 These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing./

This is very detailed, and while it could be passed on from other witnesses, I suggest that John Zebson was one of the disciples of John the Baptist already.

That this is in Bethany makes sense if this is Lazarus, though, but we're about to see some evidence that might favor it being someone with a brother. As far as we know, Lazarus has sisters, not brothers.

/29 The next day, he saw Jesus coming to him, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! 30 This is he of whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who is preferred before me, for he was before me.’ 31 I didn’t know him, but for this reason I came baptizing in water, that he would be revealed to Israel.”

32 John testified, saying, “I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven, and it remained on him. 33 I didn’t recognize him, but he who sent me to baptize in water said to me, ‘On whomever you will see the Spirit descending and remaining on him is he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.’ 34 I have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God.”

35 Again, the next day, John was standing with two of his disciples, 36 and he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!” 37 The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. 38 Jesus turned and saw them following, and said to them, “What are you looking for?”

They said to him, “Rabbi” (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), “where are you staying?”

39 He said to them, “Come and see.”

They came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day. It was about the tenth hour.†/

Think about who is most likely to write so many specifics about these events, even down to hour markers. An eyewitness, most likely. If it was Lazarus, this gospel doesn't shy away in at least some places from using Lazarus's name, so the goal of authorial avoidance would fail, if we're meant to read this perspective-yet-anon as Laz.

Imagine for a moment that this is John, of Galilee, and he was in Bethany, with John the Baptist.

Who is John the Baptist to Caiaphas?

Well, is he totally unknown? No, he's at the very least someone that Caiphas probably had to know about. I don't know who was high priest at this particular time, but Caiaphas still would likely know about John the Baptist. If he somehow escaped knowing who Jesus' inner circle was, it becomes even more implausible that he escaped knowing who John's inner circle was.

Lazarus very well might already be involved; like I said at the start of this absurdly long Answer main section, it isn't surprising if John and Lazarus knew each other. Jesus may have called John not entirely out of the blue, even if John didn't know Bap. And if he did, Bap is Jesus' cousin.

(Note "I didn't know him" clearly means didn't recognize above, by the way, in case you think it's denying that, as many ignorant skeptics claim. You can see Bap goes on to clarify that. And that likely means Bap didn't understand yet who precisely his cousin was, not that he didn't notice it was his cousin there that day.)

Remember we know that Jesus was praised in his childhood for advanced learning, and could be often recognized instantly as a Rabbi (teacher). I'm seeing connections here. If John Zebson is connected to Jesus long before the call, it wouldn't be surprising that Caiaphas might know (of) him.

/40 One of the two who heard John and followed him was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother. 41 He first found his own brother, Simon,/

Now, I don't know enough about Greek to know for sure that this is relevant, but why say "his own brother" rather than just "his brother"? In English, at least, in our culture, this would mean the speaker has a brother too.

Just to be sure this really says this, let's check LSB:

/[Jhn 1:40-41 LSB] 40 One of the two who heard John [speak] and followed Him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. 41 He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, "We have found the Messiah" (which translated means Christ)./

That's a yes. Again, I don't know if it's significant; maybe just saying "his own" is normal in their culture. But it suggests to me that the author might have a brother and his first tendency was to think about telling his brother, then to comment that Andrew went to inform his own brother too.

Remember this is what we expect in a pattern of authorial avoidance -- just like we saw in the trial of Jesus, clear signs of a POV, with most of the hints of who had the POV erased, to avoid seeming to claim too much personal honor. But enough there that you can understand he's telling you he was there and that's why he knows all these details, whoever he is.

Given all the evidence that the author is the apostle John, the evidence is thus placing John here. He's been placed in Bethany, then, and knowing John the Baptist, as one of his top followers already, and thus likely already placed as knowing Jesus indirectly, or at least knowing he was Bap's cousin, before Jesus even called him.

Back to WEBP:

/and said to him, “We have found the Messiah!” (which is, being interpreted, Christ‡).

42 He brought him to Jesus.

Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas” (which is by interpretation, Peter).

43 On the next day, he was determined to go out into Galilee, and he found Philip.

Jesus said to him, “Follow me.”

44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. 45 Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, “We have found him of whom Moses in the law and also the prophets, wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”/

I think this may imply that Nathanael of Cana was in the town of Bethsaida at the time. Remember we saw that the Zebsons were in the same fishing boat with Peter from Mark 1, so I think we have a group of friends here, living in the same town, or knowing each other for some reason. Or this could just be clarifying the connection to Andrew and Peter.

Thinking about who else might be in the John 21 boat, in addition to Peter, John, James, Thomas, and Nathanael, we have Andrew as a possibility, the brother of Peter -- maybe a bit odd that he isn't listed in John 21, but since it isn't Peter's gospel, not that odd -- and Philip, who is from the same city as Andrew and Peter, in Galilee.

Keep in mind the author is likely condensing a lot. We'll see evidence that Jesus is omniscient in a moment. It's possible he knew about Philip for unrelated reasons, but it's also possible he was told about friends of the Zebsons and the Johnsons (Peter and Andrew).

Now I'm going out on a bit of a limb here, but let's imagine that of the limited number of disciples Peter wanted to be with in John 21, it might have included his own brother.

If so, and the author lists Peter, but not Andrew, and lists Nathanael ahead of the priority of listing Andrew even though two other brothers are mentioned, it would by default suggest two possibilities:

First, that Andrew wrote John.

As this seems a bit unlikely, I would expect the other main possiblity I could think of:

That Nathanael is closer friends with the author of John than Andrew or Philip are. And Thomas might be as well.

If that friendship predated Jesus calling them, which is somewhat likely given that Andrew at least clearly already knew Bap, it would explain pretty much all of this, and the other two disciples most likely to be in the boat don't include Lazarus.

It seems more like Lazarus and his sisters were rich donors, connected in some way to Jesus and John the Baptist, likely, already, before Jesus' ministry.

It seems, then, that most likely, Andrew Johnson and John Zebson had a Bethany connection somehow or another, while Jesus and John Zechson (yes this is getting a bit confusing, I mean John the Baptist, son of Zechariah), had a Bethany connection somehow or another, and one of those two pairs of humans (one of them being also God) knew Lazarus likely through the other pair, whichever that was.

If it's likely that Caiaphas knew Lazarus, it's likely Caiaphas knew John if in fact John (apostle) is this other disciple of Bap.

So, if the disciple who Caiaphas knew is Lazarus, Caiaphas was only slightly less likely to know John, through Lazarus. All prior to the call to follow Jesus.

Then, it seems like Andrew was concerned for Peter, John Zebson was concerned for James Zebson, and John most likely knew Nathanael, who most likely was connected to Philip somehow or another.

Whether Jesus knew that because they begged him to include them, or simply because in his omniscience he knew that's what they would want, this makes sense.

And keep in mind, so far we're rooting this in the groundwork that John likely wrote the gospel of John.

We aren't directly attacking every instance of the use of "the disciple Jesus loved" as referring to John, but we are seeing that it looks like John has a Bethany connection, due to this strongly evidenced authorial connection, and likely explains who was in the fishing boat, and that isn't likely including Lazarus.

/46 Nathanael said to him, “Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?”

Philip said to him, “Come and see.”

47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said about him, “Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!”

48 Nathanael said to him, “How do you know me?”/

This may imply that while Nathanael might have known John Zebson, he didn't know Jesus yet. But in a bit, we'll see that he seems to know Jesus is a Rabbi already. Philip may have told him that already, though. Also "how do you know me?" might mean "how do you recognize me as what you just said?" per what John the Baptist said earlier.

/Jesus answered him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”

49 Nathanael answered him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are King of Israel!”

50 Jesus answered him, “Because I told you, ‘I saw you underneath the fig tree,’ do you believe? You will see greater things than these!” 51 He said to him, “Most certainly, I tell you all, hereafter you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”

Now since scholars think Bartholomew = Nathanael, let's look at some evidence for that:

Matthew 9:

/35 Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people. 36 But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them because they were harassed and scattered, like sheep without a shepherd.

37 Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest indeed is plentiful, but the laborers are few. 38  Pray therefore that the Lord of the harvest will send out laborers into his harvest.”/

10:

/1 He called to himself his twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every sickness.

2 Now the names of the twelve apostles are these. The first, Simon, who is called Peter; Andrew, his brother; James the son of Zebedee; John, his brother; 3 Philip; Bartholomew; Thomas; Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus; Lebbaeus, who was also called† Thaddaeus; 4 Simon the Zealot; and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.

5 Jesus sent these twelve out and commanded them, saying, “Don’t go among the Gentiles, and don’t enter into any city of the Samaritans. 6  Rather, go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 7  As you go, preach, saying, ‘The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!’/

His instructions continue, but the key is that if you divide the group of twelve, in the order listed here, into groups of two, you see that Philip gets listed with Bartholomew. Here that is again, with paragraph breaks added this way:

2 Now the names of the twelve apostles are these. The first, Simon, who is called Peter; Andrew, his brother;

James the son of Zebedee; John, his brother;

3 Philip; Bartholomew;

Thomas; Matthew the tax collector;

James the son of Alphaeus; Lebbaeus, who was also called† Thaddaeus;

4 Simon the Zealot; and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him./

Relevant because although nothing in the instructions or narration in Matthew (so I've been told) says that they were sent out in pairs (although Jesus does make an analogy of two birds, which might imply it, in 10:29, but I don't see anything else, at least not in close proximity).

We get that it was pairs from the parallel passage in:

Mark 6:

/7 He called to himself the twelve, and began to send them out two by two; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits./

This appears to imply that Bartholomew = Nathanael, since Philip called Nathanael according to John, and is listed with Bartholomew.

This would add evidence that one of the two others in the boat in John 21 was probably Philip.

Of course it's no surprise that Andrew is listed with his brother Peter, and James with his brother John, but of course, it then becomes all the more surprising if Andrew isn't one of the two in the John 21 boat.

(In the parallel in Luke 9:1-6 for this particular sending, neither the pairings nor the listing are included.)

It seems that that sendout was later than the following, since in both Mark and Luke, the following is listed first, although we have extrabiblical attestation that Mark didn't necessarily write in chronological order, which could be true of all four gospels as far as I know in some cases. I'm listing these in the order of results of "Bartholomew" and since the name isn't used earlier in Matthew, the other sendout came up first since Matthew is listed first.

I would need to study more / review more and I have so many tabs open trying to be thorough by Columbo rules right now I can't open more at the moment; my computer isn't handling it well, but it looks like Matthew may be condensing two incidents, while Mark and Luke tell the calling first, and then the later sendout. LSB, or at least BLB for LSB, puts Matthew 10, which we already saw, listed as parallel to Mark 3 and Luke 6, the ones I'll show below, yet for Matthew 10, it lists Mark 6 and Luke 9 as the parallel.

Mark 3:

/13 He went up into the mountain and called to himself those whom he wanted, and they went to him. 14 He appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them out to preach 15 and to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons: 16 Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter); 17 James the son of Zebedee; and John, the brother of James, (whom he called Boanerges, which means, Sons of Thunder); 18 Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot; 19 and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him./

There's no mention of sendout instructions so I think Mark is either just saying that Jesus already had told them this would eventually be part of the reason for calling twelve, or is explaining that Peter later understood that and told him so, or else is simply deducing that Jesus had that intention all along. (Or Jesus might have told them that later, but it would be natural to presume it.)

In any case, so far we still have no Nathanael, but we do have Philip listed next to Bartholomew, and the others are all accounted for. If we put them in pairs, we see that it's the same order from Matthew 10, except Andrew is moved later in the list. To indicate that, I'll presume that John and James should be counted together, and that Peter is listed a little ahead because the top three who are often listed together in other incidents, Peter, James, and John, lead the list, and then Andrew got stuck in the list later. So I won't put Peter or Andrew in pairs. Let's see if it works.

/16 Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter);

17 James the son of Zebedee; and John, the brother of James, (whom he called Boanerges, which means, Sons of Thunder);

18 Andrew;

Philip; Bartholomew;

Matthew; Thomas;

James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus;

Simon the Zealot; 19 and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him./

Compare again with the list from Matthew 10:

/2b The first, Simon, who is called Peter; Andrew, his brother;

James the son of Zebedee; John, his brother;

3 Philip; Bartholomew;

Thomas; Matthew the tax collector;

James the son of Alphaeus; Lebbaeus, who was also called† Thaddaeus;

4 Simon the Zealot; and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him./

If you start from the end of the lists, the pairings are the same, until we get to Andrew -- and Philip and Bartholomew are listed together again. Thomas and Matthew's order within the pairing is flipped, and same with James and John, but other pairings aren't flipped. This makes it look like both are related to the pairing in the sendout in Matthew 10, with the Matthew 10 list being the actual pairs sent, and Mark's list being just a general order of the disciples that preserves some of that, but it makes sense he isn't necessarily implying the pairings here intentionally, he's just preserving a memory from Peter that these were often paired together, after first preserving the memory of the top three.

So once again, Philip looks like a likely candidate to be in the John 21 boat.

You could argue that it "demotes" Andrew a bit, but he's the fourth one listed, right after the top three, so I don't think that flies.

Alternatively, it could mean the pairings represent closest friendships, in which case John would be closer to Andrew per Mark 3, and again, Andrew looks likely to be in the John 21 boat, since we know both sons of Zebedee were.

Now we have Luke 6, parallel about the naming of the twelve as apostles:

/13 When it was day, he called his disciples, and from them he chose twelve, whom he also named apostles:

14 Simon, whom he also named Peter; Andrew, his brother; James; John; Philip; Bartholomew; 15 Matthew; Thomas; James the son of Alphaeus; Simon who was called the Zealot; 16 Judas the son of James; and Judas Iscariot, who also became a traitor./

Let's list them in pairs again:

/14 Simon, whom he also named Peter; Andrew, his brother;

James; John;

Philip; Bartholomew;

15 Matthew; Thomas;

James the son of Alphaeus; Simon who was called the Zealot;

16 Judas the son of James; and Judas Iscariot, who also became a traitor./

Thaddeus / Lebbaeus is missing, but the other names all match, which seems to mean that "Judas the son of James" is Thaddeus / Lebbaeus. If they have two James (Jameses? Jameseses? Two people named James) already, and a Judas, it makes sense they might try multiple nicknames for Judas the son of James, to avoid confusion.

This Judas Jameson is swapped with Simon, now listed with James Alphson, rather than with Judas Istraitorot.

Now we were testing the idea that perhaps it's just closer to some other reason like coincidence that Jesus chose Philip to send with Bartholomew who seems to be Nathanael, and if we would have found them not listed together here, we would have said it's to be admitted as evidence that they might not be that close, thus, perhaps, Bartholomew might not be Nathanael after all, or if he is, Philip might not be in John 21.

But if we take that premise, and apply it to the end of the list, it also implies that James Alphson, Simon Zealotry, Judas Jameson, and Judas Iscariot are not all that close, or, are about as close between the four of them.

This would in turn just back up all the more that Philip is probably a close friend of Nathanael's.

Also since the brother pairings are included again, it implies the pairings are intentional, and may be about how they knew each other, in some cases, before Jesus called them.

This leaves one other list that includes Bartholomew:

Acts 1:

/13 When they had come in, they went up into the upper room where they were staying, that is Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James./

Now our pattern with Philip is broken, but interestingly not in a way that hurts our theory of who was in John 21.

If we presume that John and James should be listed together again, the pairings look like this now:

/13 When they had come in, they went up into the upper room where they were staying, that is Peter,

John, James,

Andrew,

Philip, Thomas,

Bartholomew, Matthew,

James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot,

and Judas the son of James./

Simon is still in the pairing with James Alphson by this pairing, the move we saw in Luke, and the 2-Judas group is left with only one Judas. The start of the list looks the same as Mark's disciples-called list, except the order of listing of the sons of Zebedee has flipped again, and the four in the middle are still listed close, even though Philip is now listed with Thomas, and Matthew with Bartholomew.

But in so doing, we have promoted Thomas (so to speak), and helped explain why Thomas might be in the John 21 boat, which we were told in that chapter of that book. So if we go down this list, and simply count the same number of people from John 21, we have the same people I theorized were in that boat; we have Peter, we have the sons of Zebedee, we have a Thomas, we have someone who by process of elimination seems to be Nathanael (Bartholomew), and listed *ahead* of the apparent Nathanael, we have Andrew and Philip!

Now, this can be a coincidence. Remember the Fallacy of Extrapolation mentioned earlier. We have limited data here, so we can't read too much out from these lists. But it does at least provide some additional evidence, combined with all the rest already shown, that Philip is *relatively* close to Nathanael -- and by the way, now to Thomas as well, who matches a confirmed name in that boat -- and that Matthew and below in the list are perhaps less likely to be in that boat.

Basically, it *looks* like we have "The fishermen or close friends of those fishermen... then the tax collector... then other dudes."

That seems to be consistent throughout all of these lists, and fits naturally with the other evidence we looked at.

And once again, Andrew is still ahead of the list of Thomas, and anybody else who might be Nathanael.

Now, maybe Nathanael isn't Bartholomew at all. Maybe he's one of the two considered to replace Judas Isdeadiot, or some other disciple beyond the 12.

Those other two are:

Acts 1:

/23 They put forward two: Joseph called Barsabbas, who was also called Justus, and Matthias. 24 They prayed and said, “You, Lord, who know the hearts of all men, show which one of these two you have chosen 25 to take part in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell away, that he might go to his own place.” 26 They drew lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was counted with the eleven apostles./

Maybe Matthias has nicknames, although it would be a bit weird if his nickname of Nathanael, if it exists, isn't listed here, since this Joseph gets two nicknames (they like nicknames... or translations or whatever this is).

### Rabbit: Names

Let's look at the name meanings per BLB. Be aware, this is going to be quite a diversion. If you want, click this link to skip to the conclusion: [Skip Rabbit: Names](#skip-rabbit-names)

- Joseph, Greek Ἰωσήφ, in Lingua (Ln) Ee'oh'SEYF / Iy'ohSEYF / Ioseyf (single apostrophe in Lingua is a silent sound-separator, in this case of Ee'oh'SEYF also happening to go where dash as optional syllable separator could go; Ee-oh-SEYF, with the halfway-capitalization of Ee indicating perhaps a middle emphasis, all-caps SEYF being the syllable BLB marks as emphasized, Ioseyf would be a version for capitalizing it like a normal English name)) = <b>\|"let him add"\|</b>; Hebrew יוֹסֵף Ln yohSEYF / Yoseyf = \|"Jehovah has added"\|

  That's Yeho+seph, with e and o being the vowel replacements from the short version of YHWH, Yahweh ("w" spelled originally as "u", so Yah"u"eh, or Yahu for short). With seph meaning add.

  For a name version translated into English, which is something I try to do, to get a better sense of how names seemed to the ancients (they didn't think of names as only vaguely having a meaning in some other language like we usually do in English; they usually wanted their name to mean something clear in their own language, so a real translation of the Bible should do this), I often translate Yah/Yahu as Lord, since that's how many translations refer to YHWH, and Jews used Adonai or the vowels from it to get Yehovah, and Eli/El as God.

  Despite BLB putting "has added" in quotes, the Strong's they give says it's future tense like the quoted summary BLB gave for the Greek. Translating names to English with tense for future wouldn't look good, and past sense might be a bit weird here (Lordadded...), so we could say Lordadd, or to avoid the "dad" sound, <u>Lordsum</u>, or something like that.

    It's from when Rachel named Joseph son of Jacob son of Isaac son of Abraham (not Joseph son of Jacob of the end of the genealogy in Matthew 1; that Joseph is Mary's husband), saying /Gen 30:24 - And she named him Joseph, saying, “May Yahweh [fn]give me another son.”/ but the footnote says \|Lit add to me; Heb Joseph\|. It's really Hebrew Yosehf. (In spelling. I'm not very clear on whether the Greek version of E that looks like a lowercase n is the one pronounced eh or the one pronounced ey; I just went with ey above since BLB said so.)

- Barsabbas, Greek Βαρσαβᾶς Ln Bahr'sah'BAHS, which BLB helpfully translates \|"son of Sabas"\|. And says: \|Of Aramaic origin בַּר (H1247) and probably צְבָה (H6634)\| That's bahr (well-known as the Aramaic equivalent of behn / ben, meaning son or son of), and Ln ts*b-AH.

  In Lingua, I don't have a great way to turn schwa (*, unstressed uh) into a normal letter, other than to just leave it out and keep a silent apostrophe separator, so we would get, for a more normal spelling and capitalization (not indicating syllable stress anymore): Ts'bah.

  BLB translates: \|to desire, be inclined, be willing, be pleased\| Strong's also mentions will, and we're told it corresponds to another word spelled almost identically: צְבָא. The only difference in pronunciation is they put the B with the final syllable, which I thought it was weird they didn't for the earlier one (hence I included the dash to clarify), so this would be ts*-BAH. The only spelling difference is that the final letter is the aleph vowel carrier (Hebrew's consonantal equivalent of the first letter of the alphabet although it isn't a vowel, but similar to our letter A or Greek's alpha, from which we get "alphabet") instead of the final silent H of the other one.

  We're told this one means to fight, war, serve, assemble, muster, wait upon, etc.

  I suggest using a play on the common English name of "Will." But could also be War or something like that. For "Son of" I usually flip the order, removing any prepositions, turning the object of the preposition into an adjective. If you didn't, you would get Sonwill or Sonwar, which might be better because you then understand the order of what means what, but hopefully everybody knows Bar and Ben mean son, so Benjamin Son of Right Hand becomes Rightson instead of the awkward Sonright, so we would get Wilson. It's all about Wilson. Or, Warson. Or <u>Willson</u> if you must be picky.

  Moving on... Anyways, those two names don't sound similar, but if Ts'bah was his father's name, we wouldn't expect it, but maybe it means willful, something like Sons of Thunder. Doesn't seem to be a translation of Joseph. BLB does say he was "surnamed" Barsabas/Barsabbas.

- Justus means Just. I'm shocked. Greek (Gk) Ἰοῦστος Ln eeUEStohs / Iu'stos. (What we might spell "Ioostohs" in normal English; ue is as in true, not "uh". We might also spell it Eustace. Well, scrub that, Eustos.) For a translation, to avoid confusion with the "mere" sense of "just," I suggest <u>Justice</u>. BLB oddly lists it also as a surname. Not sure if that word means something to them that I don't think it means.

- Matthias looks to mean essentially the same as Matthew. This is going to get complicated, but both seem to mean gift of God/Lord.

  For Matthias, they say \|"gift of God"\| for the Greek form as it is in Acts here: Μαθθίας Ln mahTHIYahs / Ma'thiahs, and \|Apparently a shortened form of Ματταθίας (G3161)\| (Mattithiah), yet for that word they say \|"gift of Jehovah"\|. The -s suffix is, I think, just a common thing with Greek names, so I think this is really from Yah, which I see on the end of this: \|Of Hebrew origin מַתַּתְיָה (H4993)\| which I'll show the full details of later below. But that would be Lord in my system, not God.

  God in Greek would be theos, which it just happens to look like thias in Matthias, but this seems to be a coincidence, since the Hebrew really did have a "t" of the type often spelled TH, sometimes argued to be pronounced T + H (not our English "th" sound as in "thin" but like "tin" with a blowing breath sound as you release the T, what in Ln full would be T'hin, not to be confused with t'-hin with t' as a separate syllable implying schwa -- but I've seen arguments that in ancient Hebrew, unlike modern Hebrew, it really was pronounced like English th as in thin, so I just spell my Lingua transliterations that way for Hebrew th).

  It seems like BLB flubbed here, or they don't care so much about translating YHWH as "Lord" consistently (what here they call "Jehovah"). And Lord isn't translated; it's normally turned into kurios in Greek (the standard transliteration from memory), so this Matthias looks indeed to be shortened raw transliteration of Hebrew (Hb) Mattithiah מַתַּתְיָה Ln Mah-tihth-*YAH / Mahtihth'YAH / Matihth'YAH / Matihth'yah.

  Here for translating the name, in my system, we run into a problem, where I don't like to end names in ways that you might confuse for a name for God. A raw translation would be Giftlord (or if BLB were right for the Gk, Giftgod). In my name translation system it's better to flip the order of the parts than to avoid such confusions (we're not calling this human a God of gifts; in English Giftgod or Giftlord looks like Gift as adjectival noun of noun God/Lord, which would mean it could be flipped to the object of the preposition of).

  So I would end up with Godgift, or Lordgift more accurately, or to avoid the unfortunate connotation of "God's gift to humanity" a bit, let's go with <u>Lordgiven</u>. (Godgiven also is a bit too similar to "our God-given rights". And since it seems inaccurate...)

- Nathanael Gk Ναθαναήλ Ln nahth-Ahn-ah-EYL / nahthAhna'EYL / nathAhna'EYL / Nathana'eyl. \|"gift of God"\|. Well didn't see that coming! It actually does fit well with Matthias. Makes sense; they're similar-souding. This is actually a transliteration of "el" from Elohim, God, so here "gift of God" is accurate, or what in my translation system we would be reluctantly forced to call Godgiven or Godgift. Hm, I wonder if a theory that this is Matthias is why BLB translated it this way.

  I know they translate names... does Hebrew do multiple spellings with the same meaning while still in Hebrew? That's what it now seems like this would be...

  It's still most likely based on the mention of his calling early in John that Nathanael has to be a member of the twelve, but this does look like slight evidence against my theory, and for Nathanael as Matthias.

  Which means members of the 12 wouldn't be the only candidates to be in that boat (not that we were ever going to prove that anyways, but in terms of what we have evidence for, now I have at least slight evidence for someone beyond the 12, which definitely opens the door for Lazarus, assuming Lazarus would ever go fishing).

  And it wouldn't be all that surprising that John might list the calling of one of the two guys who were considered to replace Judas I-steal-a-lot, nor would it be surprising that they might want to go fishing with people other than members of the 12.

  They say \|Of Hebrew origin נְתַנְאֵל (H5417)\|, Ln N*th-ah-n*-EHL / N'thahnEHL / N'thanel, and that is \|"given of God"\| (Well there you go; for the Lordgift, I was justified in using Lordgiven... Anywho.) So that would be Godgiven indeed.

  Minus el, it's a variant, obviously, of a word that could be transliterated the same as Nathan (although BLB doesn't list it as such... well, not in the main two sections. The third section goes on and on and on, and even I would probably never have enough patience to follow up on all the links there, wow... and fourth...? I dunno. Kind of long, and they don't transliterate. I'm getting too tired of this rabbit hole, and that doesn't really seem relevant, I was just wondering.)

  Hb נָתַן Ln nahTHAHN / na'THAHN / naTHAN / Nathan. (Well, yeah, it does work out to the same transliteration in Lingua too as the normal name Nathan but don't confuse that with the NAYth*n pronunciation.) Meaning, to give, put, set.

  I don't see any mention here of it being related to Matthew. I really should go look that one up, but this diversion has been so long... I'm willing to just accept that "given" and "given" are potentially similar, but all the other evidence I found seems to better fit that Nathanael is Bartholomew. Let's move on to that one.

- Bartholomew. Gk Βαρθολομαῖος Ln... well, so many syllables I won't put even guesses on the "partial stress" for the first try... bahr-thohl-ohm-AH-ee-ohs. BLB says yohs for the end there and let's go with it. I'm not sure if the "bar" part, the son of part, should have syllable stress or not, but tentatively let's just go with the alternating rhythm default I use. So, bahr-Thohl-ohm-AH-yohs / bar'Thohl'ohmAHyos. And since AH followed by y can just be the "eye" sound (Ln ai), bar'Thohl'ohmAIos / Bar'thohl'ohmaios.

  To reduce apostrophes, Bar'thowlohmaios. (I have to avoid "hlo" since it would imply the H is pronounced, but the H was only there to clarify the O is oh rather than ah.)

  Technically, Lingua itself only allows "o" by itself to be a shortening of "oh," and "a" by itself can only be shortening of "ah" so as long as you know Lingua's rules, we can get it down to Bartholomaios which is actually identical to one field BLB offers calls their "Transliteration." So they and Lingua agree for once. I just normally avoid shortenings that will be mispronounced by English speakers if that's all they see.

  Anywho, it means \|"son of Tolmai"\|, and unsurprisingly since "bar" is "son of" in Aramaic, \|Of Aramaic origin בַּר (H1247) and תַּלְמַי (H8526)\|. That last is Ln Tohl*MAHy, \|"furrowed"\| or \|ridged\|. A "proper name". This isn't that relevant probably, most likely it just means Bartholomew is the son of a guy named Tolmai.

  I find that that's still good evidence that Bartholomew isn't his "first" name as we in modern English society would call it, which supports that he is really Nathanael Bartholomew. Perhaps the similarity to Matthias or Matthew might be why he was typically known by his "last name" instead, while not actually being Matthias (or Matthew for that matter, most likely), to differentiate. I feel like that's a reasonable guess, although I might just be biased for my theory here.

### Skip Rabbit: Names

Conclusion:

Surprisingly, Nathanael does mean essentially the same thing as Matthias, from Acts 2, so it's possible it's a synonym or something??? So Nathanael might not be Bartholomew after all.

(Acts 1 makes it clear Bartholomew is a member of the 12 already, and Matthias is being considered to replace Judas I-scare-a-lot there, so Bartholomew and Matthias can't be the same guy, although this doesn't disprove my theory, shared by most scholars allegedly, that Bartholomew = Nathanael.)

Nathanael could also quite possibly not be a member of the Twelve or Matthias. Either this or the Matthias theory would help support that Lazarus might be more likely to be one of the two unnamed John 21 disciples.

But I think it's by far better-evidenced that they are Andrew and Philip.

Enough of this!

pausfornow. who they? fishers all? who the two? why the zebsons turn unnamed?

/That night, they caught nothing. 4 But when day had already come, Jesus stood on the beach; yet the disciples didn’t know that it was Jesus. 5 Jesus therefore said to them, “Children, have you anything to eat?”
They answered him, “No.”
6 He said to them, “Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.”
They cast it therefore, and now they weren’t able to draw it in for the multitude of fish. 7 That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It’s the Lord!”
So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he wrapped his coat around himself (for he was naked), and threw himself into the sea. 8 But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits‡ away), dragging the net full of fish. 9 So when they got out on the land, they saw a fire of coals there, with fish and bread laid on it. 10 Jesus said to them, “Bring some of the fish which you have just caught.”
11 Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land, full of one hundred fifty-three great fish. Even though there were so many, the net wasn’t torn.
12 Jesus said to them, “Come and eat breakfast!”
None of the disciples dared inquire of him, “Who are you?” knowing that it was the Lord.
13 Then Jesus came and took the bread, gave it to them, and the fish likewise. 14 This is now the third time that Jesus was revealed to his disciples after he had risen from the dead. 15 So when they had eaten their breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me more than these?”
He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you.”
He said to him, “Feed my lambs.” 16 He said to him again a second time, “Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me?”
He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you.”
He said to him, “Tend my sheep.” 17 He said to him the third time, “Simon, son of Jonah, do you have affection for me?”
Peter was grieved because he asked him the third time, “Do you have affection for me?” He said to him, “Lord, you know everything. You know that I have affection for you.”
Jesus said to him, “Feed my sheep. 18  Most certainly I tell you, when you were young, you dressed yourself and walked where you wanted to. But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you don’t want to go.”
19 Now he said this, signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. When he had said this, he said to him, “Follow me.”
20 Then Peter, turning around, saw a disciple following. This was the disciple whom Jesus loved, the one who had also leaned on Jesus’ chest at the supper and asked, “Lord, who is going to betray you?” 21 Peter, seeing him, said to Jesus, “Lord, what about this man?”
22 Jesus said to him, “If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to you? You follow me.” 23 This saying therefore went out among the brothers§ that this disciple wouldn’t die. Yet Jesus didn’t say to him that he wouldn’t die, but, “If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to you?”
24 This is the disciple who testifies about these things, and wrote these things. We know that his witness is true. 25 There are also many other things which Jesus did, which if they would all be written, I suppose that even the world itself wouldn’t have room for the books that would be written.

# End Notes:
### Bible Citations
- Bible quotes may be enclosed in slashes (e.g. /In the beginning.../), especially if extended.
- Copypasted from Blue Letter Bible (BLB).
- For shorter pages on this site, Bible version will usually be Legacy Standard Bible version (LSB) unless otherwise specified. See [here](https://www.blueletterbible.org/bibles/preface-to-the-legacy-standard-bible.cfm) for their format notes.
- I may put LSB italicized words (words not in the source) in square brackets ("[]") for easy .txt file copying of my content (.txt files, of the Windows Notepad app, take up very little space to store, but don't preserve italics, bold, etc.).
- Citation formats may also be in square brackets (when auto-generated by BLB).
- Quoted parallel fragments separated by slash (e.g. /expanse / heavens/).
- Extended quotes of extrabiblical sources may be delimited with "\|" (pipe) characters. Curly brackets "{}" could also be used; pipe has to be escaped with backslash in this coding format (Markdown, with some HTML) indicating a literal character rather than a table, but pipe looks much better.
- I may still use normal quote marks as well in some cases.
- The LSB has some limitations of general permission to quote, such as only up to a thousand quotes in one work ([see details here](https://lsbible.org/permission-to-quote-the-lsb/)). So for extended quotes or whole-Bible-study articles or ones that otherwise will likely quote from many books of the Bible open-endedly, I default to the [World English Bible](https://ebible.org/web/GEN01.htm), as a decent modern [Public Domain](https://ebible.org/web/copyright.htm) version (WEBP, don't confuse with Webster's Bible (WEB), although WEBP is sometimes called WEB too). So I may use that instead, or partially, likely with specification. Other versions may be quoted or cited, with specification.
- LSB as represented on BLB uses inline "[fn]" links to footnotes as popups. When I copypaste from BLB LSB, I will preserve these, as an indicator you can go to BLB to see what the popup says (and so I don't have to manually edit each such quote). These are placed before the word or phrase they apply to. However, I will not typically be quoting the footnotes here.
- LSB requires web pages that use quotes of LSB to include the following copyright notice:

### Cite or Contact Me?
Please think twice about citing me as if I was an authoritative source. I'm just a nobody layman with a brain who's dying (hopefully of old age), so I wanted to know what would happen after, and what I should do about it. As should all. I happened to learn a lot, including a layman focus on logic. So in case it would help people I try to make what I know available to others, but you should be doing your own study.

If you want to cite me, you can refer to me by my email: idealparable@gmail.com.

If you have questions, be aware I might not be very responsive at that email. I don't like to spend much time on one-on-one answers as that only directly goes to one person at a time. We have a whole globe of billions of people to be informed. But you can try if you must. It's a Charlie Brown mailbox, though, and unlike him, I usually don't bother checking. Expect delays.

**If you know my real name, do not tell others.** I don't agree with giving out personal information online.
