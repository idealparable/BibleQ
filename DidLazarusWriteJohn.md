# Did Lazarus Write John? Is he the Disciple Jesus Loved?

**Question(s):** It's been suggested that Lazarus is the one referred to as the disciple Jesus loved, commonly thought to be John, since messengers tell Jesus that the one he loves (not disciple he loves, note) is sick, and we're told this is Lazarus.

An obvious initial problem is that this disciple is said to be the author of the gospel of John, in the final chapter. So did Lazarus write John?

My answer below will be no, that's highly unlikely. As I understand it, arguments for Lazarus as the "Disciple Loved," or DiLoved as I'll call it for short, are making some important misunderstandings related (hopefully unintentionally) to some core doctrine (especially Trinity), apologetics (debunking countless Bible contradictions), and proper interpretation (how to know when "all" is literal).

I'll try to walk through major arguments pro/con with Scriptural quotes backing it up, and explain why I think John phrased things this way.

I could be wrong, now, but I don't think so.

# Answer
John and Lazarus were both very close friends of Jesus. It isn't surprising that John exclusively focuses on Lazarus in his gospel.

Final chapter of John makes it crystal clear the disciple in question is a fisherman (Lazarus doesn't seem to be), and is the author of the gospel, and the style of the gospel is very clearly the same as the author of the three epistles also attributed to the apostle John.

Ancient attestation is also unanimous that the names on the always-used scroll tags in every manuscript library, for all four gospels, are the authors of those gospels, contrary to populist pseudoscholarship claims of opponents in the current historical era (circa 2024 AD).

So we know far beyond a reasonable doubt that John authored the gospel by his name.

And other context makes it clear that (and why) John was referring to himself anonymously within the body text of his gospel.

In short, it was at least almost-definitely to follow an authorial avoidance strategy that Jesus pointed his closest disciples to, evidently, by his focus on "from the beginning" as an interpretive key, when in his Pre-Incarnate nature authored (I think, and will explain some of why below) Genesis 1-2:4, signing it in 2:4 as "the LORD God" (Yahweh God in LSB, WEBP) but avoiding mention of himself as the Person of the Son by that name within the body text of that initial account.

Much about that is highly disputed by others, and isn't the primary focus of this article but I've found their arguments extremely wanting, and I may cover it later.

And I think we can see where and why John likely started to place personal importance on the word "love" as reflected throughout his writing style in both the gospel and his epistles -- even in his very report of the messengers about Lazarus.

This is the mark of John's authorship and identity as the disciple Jesus loved (DiLoved)!

One of Jesus' statements in John's version of the chapter where the DiLoved phrase is first used looks like it's the reason this was impressed on John -- note, right after Peter asked him (if it's him) to ask Jesus who was the betrayer; that would psychologically "wake John up" to pay even closer attention to everything surrounding this event than even anyone else:

John 13:

/34  A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also love one another.

35  By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”/

John focuses on this -- if John is writing this gospel, as it seems crystal clear he did. Given the context, no wonder this impressed itself on him so strongly.

This would influence his common word choice.

Note that the DiLoved phrase is first used in this chapter, right at the part where Peter asks him to ask Jesus.

This is a clear physchological connection between the phrase and this crucial statement by Jesus. Remember that John wrote this later -- long after this statement would have impressed itself on John's memory and heavily affected his typical wording style.

Let's start to look at specific arguments and evidence.

## Don't Quote the Messenger

One error that may be being made by Laz=DiLoved proponents (arguments may vary, and I'm not assuming it's an error but hear me out) is based on seeing this passage as definitely *quoting* the messengers (the phrase in question I'll put in bold emphasis):

John 11:

/1 Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister, Martha. 2 It was that Mary who had anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.

3 The sisters therefore sent to him, saying, **“Lord, behold, he for whom you have great affection is sick.”**

4 But when Jesus heard it, he said, “This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that God’s Son may be glorified by it.” 5 Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus./

LSB has it as /"Lord, behold, **he whom You love** is sick."/

Quote marks didn't exist in Greek.

Usually these were paraphrases.

This is most likely *John's paraphrase* of the content of the messengers' message.

*Not* likely a direct quote.

Let's sum up this phrase "he whom you love" or its meaning, 'he whom Jesus loved' as **HeLoved**.

We know that "**HeLoved**" = Lazarus.

Does HeLoved = DiLoved? (DiscipleLoved?)

Note: This does mean that Jesus' statement in John 13 isn't necessarily quoted either. But it makes sense that John is passing on Jesus' statement on this. Jesus is paraphrased or potentially quoted as making similar statements in other gospels, such as this:

Matthew 22:

/37 Jesus said to him, “ ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’* 38  This is the first and great commandment.

39  A second likewise is this, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’* 40  The whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments.”/

See also Mark 12:30-31, Luke 1:27-28.

So this focus on the word love and relating it to commandments comes from Jesus most likely, not originating first with John, but John seems to have put his own personal style to it.

I'll try to walk through a lot of examples of similar wordings in John and 1/2/3 John later.

First, let's focus on most of the pro-Lazarus-as-DiLoved arguments that I've been able to find from some promoters online.

## Non-LiterALL

One argument that it has to be the same person is that the one called the disciple Jesus loved can't be John, or any of the "disciples" (see a problem already?) because Jesus and narrators of gospels say that all / each of the "disciples" scattered each to their own home, yet an anonymous disciple did follow Jesus, and helped Peter gain entrance to the courtyard of the high priest (I'll show the quote [later](#disciple-isnt-disciple)).

Example:

John 16:

/32  Behold, the time is coming, yes, and has now come, that **you will be scattered, <u><i>every</i></u>one to his own place, and you will leave me alone.** Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me./

First, although it's not my main point, how far do they need to be to qualify for "leave me alone"? I suggest they all scattered, and "left him alone," and perhaps eventually literally all went home separately (they may even have taken that part as instructions by that point), but in any case, my main argument allows for that this isn't literal.

The pro-Lazarus-as-DiLoved argument (which may vary) in this case appears to assume that "all" means literally all, in all cases -- or, perhaps, implies an argument that if it doesn't, we have a problem.

Not so, as I understand it.

## Say Again?

Hebrew "language culture" (how their culture used language, regardless of whether expressing their thoughts in Hebrew, Greek, or Aramaic or anything else) used *repetition* of "all" or synonyms to push toward a literal / universal all.

Notice in the verse I quoted above, Jesus only uses an "all" word once.

By default, this then should be seen as probably not absolute/literal, but that MOST of them would scatter and return to their homes.

It's true that we have more than one statement like this, but how close by do they need to be to indicate a literal-all?

(Or as I call it, a "literall".)

As we clearly see, "each to his own home" can't mean a literal all in this case (or at least not right away), at least not in any sense that would forbid this unnamed disciple from being John since John is one of the twelve, since Peter is also a disciple, by both the general definition and in the sense of one of the 12, and he also followed. In addition to this being said in John, it's said in Matthew too:

Matthew 26:

/56  But all this has happened that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.”

Then **all the disciples left him and fled.**

57 Those who had taken Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.

58 **But Peter followed him from a distance** to the court of the high priest, and entered in and sat with the officers, to see the end./

You can see here that by "all," Matthew clearly doesn't mean literally all.

If you didn't know before that Hebrew "language culture" has a non-literal-all, you should know it when you read this.

As we'll see [later](#disciple-isnt-disciple) from the gospel of John version of this, Peter and the "another disciple" in question are placed in parallel in terms of following Jesus, so this exception refers to two "disciples."

## Before You Flood Me With Objections

By contrast, we know for a standard example that "all" and synonyms are literal/absolute in the case of the extent of the Noahic Floodwaters by its over-over-over-repetition, including three direct synonyms of "all" (in bold below and underlined) and some other superlatives (italic and underlined) about the extent of the water (these three will be all-capitalized), and many more about all land "flesh" dying outside the ark (I'll put the accumulating count for these in parentheses).

Genesis 6:

/13 God said to Noah, “I will bring an end to <u><b>all (1)</b></u> flesh, for the earth is filled with violence through them. Behold, I will destroy them and the earth.

...

17 I, even I, will bring the flood of waters on this earth, to destroy <u><b>all (2)</b></u> flesh having the breath of life from under the sky. 

<u><b>Every (3)</b></u>thing that is in the earth will die. 18 But I will establish my covenant with you. You shall come into the ship, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives with you. 19 Of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ship, to keep them alive with you. They shall be male and female./

(Keep in mind the listed exceptions don't change the otherwise universal nature of these statements, although that does mean they aren't literally all flesh under the sky dying. I'm not counting the "every" in 19 since that's about the exceptions. Also not counting the "alls" for Noah obeying, etc. Just about all flesh dying and the waters covering all land.)

7:
/4 In seven days, I will cause it to rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights. I will destroy <u><b>every (4)</b></u> living thing that I have made from the surface of the ground.”

...

17 The flood was forty days on the earth. The waters <u><i>INCREASED</i></u> and lifted up the ship, and it was lifted up above the earth. 18 The waters rose, and <u><i>INCREASED GREATLY,</i></u> on the earth; and the ship floated on the surface of the waters. 19 The waters rose <u><i>VERY</i></u> high on the earth.

<u><b>ALL</b></u> the high mountains that were under the <u><b>WHOLE</b></u> sky were covered.

20 The waters rose fifteen cubits† higher, and the mountains were covered. 21 <u><b>All (5)</b></u> flesh died that moved on the earth, including birds, livestock, animals, <u><b>>every (6)</b>></u> creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and <u><b>>every (7)</b>></u> man.

22 <u><b>>All (8)</b></u> on the dry land, in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, died. 23 <u><b>Every (9)</b></u> living thing was destroyed that was on the surface of the ground, including man, livestock, creeping things, and birds of the sky. They were destroyed from the earth. <u><b>Only (10)</b></u> Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ship. 24 The waters flooded the earth one hundred fifty days./

8:

/9 but the dove found no place to rest her foot, and she returned into the ship to him, for the waters were on the surface of the <u><b>WHOLE</b></u> earth. He put out his hand, and took her, and brought her to him into the ship./

That's a total of three "alls" for water extent on land/earth, with three additional superlatives.

And an astonishing ten "alls" for land flesh dying.

If I can count. Which is often in question.

This approach to language allows the Hebrew system to communicate clearly in any language -- including English or any other translation.

This shouldn't surprise us as the all-knowing God chose this language as the one for his original largest chosen culture which preserved his message to humanity, and the language for that message to primarily be in, for OT.

God obviously fore-knew we would be translating it into every language we could.

This is also similar to the rule about parallelism as usually implying equivalence or some other close relationship. This is a structure we can see in translation, although some lower-priority structures do get lost a bit like the common plays on words in Hebrew.

You also have to look at the logic flow, and proximity to other passages that may repeat the "all," in each case.

For example, what about this one?

6:

/22 Thus Noah did. He did all that God commanded him./

Did he do only most of what God commanded?

Well, a few verses later we have:

7:

/5 Noah did everything that Yahweh commanded him./

He didn't necessarily need to repeat it, but he does.

Notice this is all still the same basic section, so we should read these as most likely modifying each other. We know that because of the logic flow in this case.

## Paul's All

Paul himself talked about this principle here:

1st Corinthians 15:

/27 For, “He put all things in subjection under his feet.”*

But when he says, “All things are put in subjection”, it is evident that he is excepted who subjected all things to him.

28 When all things have been subjected to him, then the Son will also himself be subjected to him who subjected all things to him, that God may be all in all./

## He Is Not Just Talking About Bread

Some of Jesus' statements on legitimate exceptions for "work" on the Sabbath likely also apply, especially what he said here:

Mark 2:

/23 He was going on the Sabbath day through the grain fields; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of grain.

24 The Pharisees said to him, “Behold, why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day?”

25 He said to them, “Did you never read what David did when he had need and was hungry—he, and those who were with him?

26  How he entered into God’s house at the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the show bread, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and gave also to those who were with him?”

27 He said to them, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. 28  Therefore the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.”/

This was referring to [1 Samuel 21:1-6](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/1sa/21/1).

For his own disciples in the present, this was probably at least partially about that he was instituting the new covenant predicted by Moses. (Details below.)

But about David, it's about how the implied "all" in all (all) didactic law (the legal genre that all all all ancient law was in, including the Law of Moses) isn't necessarily literal and depended on all (all) the other laws in it, in full full full context in the Mosaic Law, and would be determined on a case by case basis by the judges.

This is why the law was given, evidently, immediately after the setting up of the judge heirarchy. (See Exodus 18, where Jethro advises this, then 19 where the law begins to be revealed.)

The idea that exceptions always need to be explicitly spelled out up front is a modern one, so the objection is anachronistic. Social scientist Bruce Malina has documented this in detail (see for example his *Handbook of Biblical Social Values*, a must-read source recommended by JPH (see abbreviations list in end notes)).

For the part about Jesus' application to his disciples as Lord of the Sabbath, see here:

Deuteronomy 18:

/5 Yahweh your God will raise up to you a prophet from among you, of your brothers, like me. You shall listen to him. 16 This is according to all that you desired of Yahweh your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, “Let me not hear again Yahweh my God’s voice, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I not die.”

17 Yahweh said to me, “They have well said that which they have spoken. 18 I will raise them up a prophet from among their brothers, like you. I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him. 19 It shall happen, that whoever will not listen to my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him./

This was where Moses, passing on God's words, "spoke of" Jesus, as Jesus said he did.

That he was predicting a new covenant might be a bit subtle, but establishing a covenant was what Moses did (the Mosaic covenant) so that's implied in the "like me." Also in the "listen to him." Basically this means when Christ came, it would be his prerogative to establish a new covenant, or not to, however God chose, and whether it would replace the Mosaic one (as a branch off of it, as all previous covenants had been except arguably a replacement Adamic one when Adam and Eve sinned), or else replace it (as clearly it did, as a branch off of the Abrahamic, which the Mosaic also branched off of).

That it would indeed be a new covenant was explicitly confirmed here, as well as that it would not be a branch off of the Mosaic covenant:

Jeremiah 31:

/31 “Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah,

32 not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, which covenant of mine they broke, although I was a husband to them,” says Yahweh.

33 “But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days,” says Yahweh:

“I will put my law in their inward parts,

and I will write it in their heart.

I will be their God,
and they shall be my people.

34 They will no longer each teach his neighbor,
and every man teach his brother, saying, ‘Know Yahweh;’
for they will all know me,
from their least to their greatest,” says Yahweh,
“for I will forgive their iniquity,
and I will remember their sin no more.”/

By beginning to establish new rules for the ceremonial aspects of life like how to behave on the Sabbath, Jesus was hinting that he was the Christ, Son of God (as many other passages made it clear the Messiah would be God, beyond the scope of this article, but planned for others later). So he was initiating the New Covenant, after which the New Testament is named (Testament means Covenant).

Obviously, David was before this, so Jesus' point was not that Jesus was simply suspending the law as God beforehand, though he could do that too. His point is about how the law always worked, and this includes its "all" statements.

JPH has more material on this including historical evidence that this is how it was interpreted.

## Disciple isn't Disciple?

Another obvious problem with the "it can't be John because he's a disciple and all the disciples went home" argument is that, well, the phrase in question is the *disciple* Jesus loved.

This argument works from this passage:

John 18:

/12 So the detachment, the commanding officer, and the officers of the Jews seized Jesus and bound him, 13 and led him to Annas first, for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. 14 Now it was Caiaphas who advised the Jews that it was expedient that one man should perish for the people.

15 Simon Peter followed Jesus, as did another disciple.

Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest; 16 but Peter was standing at the door outside.

So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought in Peter./

This doesn't include the "loved" part, but it does include the anonimity, oddness of the anonymity (occasional references to various unnamed sdisciples aren't necessarily surprising, but this one is emphasized and the wording used a few times here.), and, obviously, the word "disciple."

Parsimoniously, this is the same one referred to by the DiLoved phrase in the incident with the dipping of bread, and in the final chapter of John, the other key uses.

Now I find this argument *somewhat plausible,* because there can be two senses of "disciple."

A common error is thinking that one word always has one meaning only, or that if it doesn't it's a problem. No.

It *would* make sense to me that the "disciple" here (and perhaps the bread-dipping case, but not the final chapter of John) could be Lazarus. We see that the word can be used in a general sense of any follower of Christ, and Christian:

John 8:

/31 Jesus therefore said to those Jews who had believed him, “If you remain in my word, then you are truly my disciples./

The Bible often switches between senses of words. It was normal practice and a sign of a worthy wordsmith to switch between them in close proximity without spelling out that the word was shifting, and rely on the intelligent reader to see the difference.

This was part of how the wisdom teacher would sort the fool from the wise student.

Like, I like the like count like I liked them all myself as the likeness of alike likers.

Here, it would be that when Jesus and narrators say "all disciples" scattered, they mean all among the 12 only, but that Lazarus can be a disciple in a more general sense.

That specific argument itself I have no problem with, so far as it alone goes, but it becomes a problem in these two ways beyond just itself:

First, when we simultaneously think that "all" disciples scattering rules out the 12, because we can't allow "all" to also have multiple senses. This is inconsistent reasoning.

Second, if we argue that this somehow implies this disciple can't be John.

If Lazarus can be the "disciple" who accompanied Peter (and, to be fair, he can; most likely it wasn't just the 12; I think Mark was the anonymous young man who fled in Mark, for example), and the one at the Last Supper (I'm less sure Lazarus can be this one at time of writing this paragraph), then he can be among the disciples told they would "all" scatter, and especially in Matthew would be among the ones near Peter who Matthew says "all" scattered, according to John 18:15 (quoted above).

So the argument, while valid, actually goes nowhere.

## Known to the high priest?

Another argument is that Lazarus is a better candidate than John to be known to the high priest (see passage quote in above section).

John was "just" a fisherman.

True, although to use this as an argument seems dubious; even if we grant for sake of argument that he's just as normal a mere fisherman as every other fisherman, and that this would mean that in that status alone, he can't be known to the high priest, why can't he become known to him in some sense later like knowing he's one of Jesus' inner circle?

But let's grant it all for now, for sake of argument. Caiphas is simply hopelessly uninformed, and he only knows Lazarus because connections and Lazarus lived nearby, we'll say.

Then there's a bit of a problem:

John 12:

/9 A large crowd therefore of the Jews learned that he was there; and they came, not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.

10 But the chief priests conspired to put Lazarus to death also, 11 because on account of him many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus./

Let's assume that Lazarus didnt flee Judea due to this, although I've heard it said that extrabiblical sources may claim or imply he did.

Even if not, he probably knew this, so would hardly risk going even within a guarded gate right to the very people trying to kill him.

It might be argued that whoever recorded this only found it out later, but the wording of "but" here seems to imply to me that it was known at the time and that Lazarus at least was trying to lay low.

That's also consistent with the type of culture they were, where everybody essentially told everybody everything about everybody all of the time. JPH's social science sources have much to say on this.

The Bible does record some cases of the general public knowing about intent to kill Jesus:

John 7:

/25 Therefore some of them of Jerusalem said, “Isn’t this he whom they seek to kill? 26 Behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the Christ?/

Although to be fair, they might have gotten that idea from Jesus himself:

John 7 (a few verses earlier):

/19  Didn’t Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me?”

20 The multitude answered, “You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?”/

Still, it looks like the author is saying that the people did know that they really were trying to kill them; that they already knew that before Jesus said that.

Earlier in the chapter, it was mentioned that Jesus knew this too, though of course he may have known that only through his omniscience. But in general it seems clear to me that this was common knowledge.

It's also possible for Jesus to warn Lazarus about the plot on his life too.

So regardless of whether Lazarus was known to the high priest, it seems highly unlikely that right during the arrest of Jesus himself, that Lazarus would risk going right to the same people who did that.

Far more likely it's a "lower target."

But Peter shows that he "feels the heat" (so to speak, in the cold, while trying to stay warm by the fire), so all the more, Lazarus would, when Peter denies Christ three times (specifically denies being a "disciple" of him, ironically, in John's wording in John 18:17,25, then denies being in Gethsemane in 26-27), as Christ foretold he would.

That this unnamed disciple who is known to the high priest is only mentioned in John (the gospel), and the identity of the fisherman DiLoved with the Last Supper DiLoved (read on) makes it clear that anonymity and the word "disciple" are the author's mark, and all the evidence that the author is John (again read on for deets), makes it highly likely that this is the author expressing his own perspective.

Note again how detailed it is about specifically who moved where when:

John 18:

/15 Simon Peter followed Jesus, as did another disciple.

Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest; 16 but Peter was standing at the door outside.

So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought in Peter.

17 Then the maid who kept the door said to Peter, “Are you also one of this man’s disciples?”

He said, “I am not.”

18 Now the servants and the officers were standing there, having made a fire of coals, for it was cold.

They were warming themselves.

Peter was with them, standing and warming himself./

And it goes on like this. This is clear authorial POV.

This unnamed disciple continues to be here -- he doesn't disappear -- and likely remains with Jesus the whole time, a little distant (likely literally so that Jesus is "alone" but like at the back of the crowd in the "trials", or some of them (probably not with Pilate though, although specific reports of where Pilate walked are included, so probably nearby), and is then the one at the cross who is told that Mary, mother of Jesus, is now his mother to take care of, and he her son.

John 19:

/25 But standing by Jesus’ cross were his mother, his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.

26 Therefore when Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother, “Woman, behold, your son!”

27 Then he said to the disciple, “Behold, your mother!” From that hour, the disciple took her to his own home./

Note here that "the disciple whom he loved" is placed in parallel with "the disciple." That can be just normal shortening for the second reference, but it might also comment back on "the disciple" earlier who came with Peter to the courtyard, and this is almost certainly the same one here.

Since DiLoved is, again almost certainly, the apostle John per logic from the final chapter of the gospel, this is John. And so the disciple who was known to the high priest, Caiaphas, is John.

Why?

Why would Caiaphas know a fisherman?

Well, for a moment, let's drop our earlier for-sake-of-argument concession that somehow Caiaphas doesn't know who the inner circle of disciples are who are always there when this Jesus guy is being a thorn in his side. He could simply know that John has interest in what happens to Jesus. And that Nicodemus has no influence here, or any of the others like him.

Now let's pick up that odd concession we made, though.

In a worst-case scenario where the only explanation can be tied to John as he was before Jesus called him, a fisherman from Galilee, I still see several possibilities.

First, John and James were of a fisherman family. This makes it possible they were a somewhat successful one. Any success at all is possible to open up connections to elites like Caiaphas. The same idea is used to suggest how Lazarus might be known to him, although Lazarus lived much closer.

Second, we can't rule out a family connection without data to the contrary. Some uncle of John's might be a local synagogue leader who might have some connection to Caiphas, or to the Jerusalem leadership in general.

Third, what does "known to the high priest" mean specifically and how do we know?

Does it mean Caiaphas personally knew him?

Not necessarily, due to the cultural language rule of embedding.

## Embedding in Body

Embedding refers to the common linguistic practice of referring to everybody under a leader as if they are that leader.

We see embedding with the parallel passages about the centurion here:

Matthew 8:

/5 When he came into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking him for help, 6 saying, “Lord, my servant lies in the house paralyzed, grievously tormented.”

7 Jesus said to him, “I will come and heal him.”

8 The centurion answered, “Lord, I’m not worthy for you to come under my roof. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed. 9 For I am also a man under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and tell another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and tell my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”

10 When Jesus heard it, he marveled and said to those who followed, “Most certainly I tell you, I haven’t found so great a faith, not even in Israel. 11  I tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven, 12  but the children of the Kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”

13 Jesus said to the centurion, “Go your way. Let it be done for you as you have believed.” His servant was healed in that hour./

Matthew is condensing the details that don't matter as much for the sake of the audience, drawing their attention to the key aspects of this event, but Luke gives more directly literal detail:

Luke 7:

/1 After he had finished speaking in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum. 2 A certain centurion’s servant, who was dear to him, was sick and at the point of death.

3 When he heard about Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and save his servant.

4 When they came to Jesus, they begged him earnestly, saying, “He is worthy for you to do this for him, 5 for he loves our nation, and he built our synagogue for us.”

6 Jesus went with them.

When he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, “Lord, don’t trouble yourself, for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof. 7 Therefore I didn’t even think myself worthy to come to you; but say the word, and my servant will be healed. 8 For I also am a man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”

9 When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned and said to the multitude who followed him, “I tell you, I have not found such great faith, no, not in Israel.”

10 Those who were sent, returning to the house, found that the servant who had been sick was well./

(This is on the populist ignorant skeptics' lists of supposed Bible contradictions, of course. Embedding is the answer.)

Embedding would, in fact, be the default expected meaning people would expect is being implied even if nobody like Luke had ever let the rest of us in on the figure of speech.

This is likely one example of a difference in initial intended audience.

We have ancient testimony that Matthew wrote originally a "Hebrew" gospel (perhaps meaning writing in Aramaic, but it may have literally meant Hebrew), and that someone (maybe Matthew himself) later translated it to Greek. Matthew is also Hebrew himself, so he may have taken it more for granted how this figure works, while Luke is thought to have been more Hellenistic, so he may have had in mind more of writing for wider audiences.

Embedding is also seen here:

1st Corinthians 12:

/27 Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually./

And the previous verses starting at 12

# End Notes:
### Bible Citations
- Bible quotes may be enclosed in slashes (e.g. /In the beginning.../), especially if extended.
- Copypasted from Blue Letter Bible (BLB).
- For shorter pages on this site, Bible version will usually be Legacy Standard Bible version (LSB) unless otherwise specified. See [here](https://www.blueletterbible.org/bibles/preface-to-the-legacy-standard-bible.cfm) for their format notes.
- I may put LSB italicized words (words not in the source) in square brackets ("[]") for easy .txt file copying of my content (.txt files, of the Windows Notepad app, take up very little space to store, but don't preserve italics, bold, etc.).
- Citation formats may also be in square brackets (when auto-generated by BLB).
- Quoted parallel fragments separated by slash (e.g. /expanse / heavens/).
- Extended quotes of extrabiblical sources may be delimited with "\|" (pipe) characters. Curly brackets "{}" could also be used; pipe has to be escaped with backslash in this coding format (Markdown, with some HTML) indicating a literal character rather than a table, but pipe looks much better.
- I may still use normal quote marks as well in some cases.
- The LSB has some limitations of general permission to quote, such as only up to a thousand quotes in one work ([see details here](https://lsbible.org/permission-to-quote-the-lsb/)). So for extended quotes or whole-Bible-study articles or ones that otherwise will likely quote from many books of the Bible open-endedly, I default to the [World English Bible](https://ebible.org/web/GEN01.htm), as a decent modern [Public Domain](https://ebible.org/web/copyright.htm) version (WEBP, don't confuse with Webster's Bible (WEB), although WEBP is sometimes called WEB too). So I may use that instead, or partially, likely with specification. Other versions may be quoted or cited, with specification.
- LSB as represented on BLB uses inline "[fn]" links to footnotes as popups. When I copypaste from BLB LSB, I will preserve these, as an indicator you can go to BLB to see what the popup says (and so I don't have to manually edit each such quote). These are placed before the word or phrase they apply to. However, I will not typically be quoting the footnotes here.
- LSB requires web pages that use quotes of LSB to include the following copyright notice:
"Scripture quotations taken from the (LSB®) Legacy Standard Bible®, Copyright © 2021 by The Lockman Foundation. Used by permission. All rights reserved. Managed in partnership with Three Sixteen Publishing Inc.  [LSBible.org](https://lsbible.org/) and [316publishing.com](https://316publishing.com/)."

### Cite or Contact Me?
Please think twice about citing me as if I was an authoritative source. I'm just a nobody layman with a brain who's dying (hopefully of old age), so I wanted to know what would happen after, and what I should do about it. As should all. I happened to learn a lot, including a layman focus on logic. So in case it would help people I try to make what I know available to others, but you should be doing your own study.

If you want to cite me, you can refer to me by my email: idealparable@gmail.com.

If you have questions, be aware I might not be very responsive at that email. I don't like to spend much time on one-on-one answers as that only directly goes to one person at a time. We have a whole globe of billions of people to be informed. But you can try if you must. It's a Charlie Brown mailbox, though, and unlike him, I usually don't bother checking. Expect delays.

**If you know my real name, do not tell others.** I don't agree with giving out personal information online.
