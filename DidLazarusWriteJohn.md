# Did Lazarus Write John? Is he the Disciple Jesus Loved?

**Question(s):** It's been suggested that Lazarus is the one referred to as the disciple Jesus loved, commonly thought to be John, since messengers tell Jesus that the one he loves (not disciple he loves, note) is sick, and we're told this is Lazarus.

An obvious initial problem is that this disciple is said to be the author of the gospel of John, in the final chapter. So did Lazarus write John?

My answer below will be no, that's highly unlikely. As I understand it, arguments for Lazarus as the "Disciple Loved," or DiLoved as I'll call it for short, are making some important misunderstandings related (hopefully unintentionally) to some core doctrine (especially Trinity), apologetics (debunking countless Bible contradictions), and proper interpretation (how to know when "all" is literal).

I'll try to walk through major arguments pro/con with Scriptural quotes backing it up, and explain why I think John phrased things this way.

I could be wrong, now, but I don't think so.

# Answer
John and Lazarus were both very close friends of Jesus. It isn't surprising that John exclusively focuses on Lazarus in his gospel.

Final chapter of John makes it crystal clear the disciple in question is a fisherman (Lazarus doesn't seem to be), and is the author of the gospel, and the style of the gospel is very clearly the same as the author of the three epistles also attributed to the apostle John.

Ancient attestation is also unanimous that the names on the always-used scroll tags in every manuscript library, for all four gospels, are the authors of those gospels, contrary to populist pseudoscholarship claims of opponents in the current historical era (circa 2024 AD).

So we know far beyond a reasonable doubt that John authored the gospel by his name.

And other context makes it clear that (and why) John was referring to himself anonymously within the body text of his gospel.

In short, it was at least almost-definitely to follow an authorial avoidance strategy that Jesus pointed his closest disciples to, evidently, by his focus on "from the beginning" as an interpretive key, when in his Pre-Incarnate nature authored (I think, and will explain some of why below) Genesis 1-2:4, signing it in 2:4 as "the LORD God" (Yahweh God in LSB, WEBP) but avoiding mention of himself as the Person of the Son by that name within the body text of that initial account.

Much about that is highly disputed by others, and isn't the primary focus of this article but I've found their arguments extremely wanting, and I may cover it later.

And I think we can see where and why John likely started to place personal importance on the word "love" as reflected throughout his writing style in both the gospel and his epistles -- even in his very report of the messengers about Lazarus.

This is the mark of John's authorship and identity as the disciple Jesus loved (DiLoved)!

One of Jesus' statements in John's version of the chapter where the DiLoved phrase is first used looks like it's the reason this was impressed on John -- note, right after Peter asked him (if it's him) to ask Jesus who was the betrayer; that would psychologically "wake John up" to pay even closer attention to everything surrounding this event than even anyone else:

**John 13:**

<b>/34  A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also love one another.</b>

<b>35  By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”/</b>

John focuses on this -- if John is writing this gospel, as it seems crystal clear he did. Given the context, no wonder this impressed itself on him so strongly.

This would influence his common word choice.

Note that the DiLoved phrase is first used in this chapter, right at the part where Peter asks him to ask Jesus.

This is a clear physchological connection between the phrase and this crucial statement by Jesus. Remember that John wrote this later -- long after this statement would have impressed itself on John's memory and heavily affected his typical wording style.

Let's start to look at specific arguments and evidence.


## Don't Quote the Messenger

One error that may be being made by Laz=DiLoved proponents (arguments may vary, and I'm not assuming it's an error but hear me out) is based on seeing this passage as definitely *quoting* the messengers (the phrase in question I'll put in bold emphasis):

John 11:

/1 Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister, Martha. 2 It was that Mary who had anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.

3 The sisters therefore sent to him, saying, **“Lord, behold, he for whom you have great affection is sick.”**

4 But when Jesus heard it, he said, “This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that God’s Son may be glorified by it.” 5 Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus./

LSB has it as /"Lord, behold, **he whom You love** is sick."/

Quote marks didn't exist in Greek.

Usually these were paraphrases.

This is most likely *John's paraphrase* of the content of the messengers' message.

*Not* likely a direct quote.

Let's sum up this phrase "he whom you love" or its meaning, 'he whom Jesus loved' as **HeLoved**.

We know that "**HeLoved**" = Lazarus.

Does HeLoved = DiLoved? (DiscipleLoved?)

Note: This does mean that Jesus' statement in John 13 isn't necessarily quoted either. But it makes sense that John is passing on Jesus' statement on this. Jesus is paraphrased or potentially quoted as making similar statements in other gospels, such as this:

Matthew 22:

/37 Jesus said to him, “ ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’* 38  This is the first and great commandment.

39  A second likewise is this, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’* 40  The whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments.”/

See also Mark 12:30-31, Luke 1:27-28.

So this focus on the word love and relating it to commandments comes from Jesus most likely, not originating first with John, but John seems to have put his own personal style to it.

I'll try to walk through a lot of examples of similar wordings in John and 1/2/3 John later.

First, let's focus on most of the pro-Lazarus-as-DiLoved arguments that I've been able to find from some promoters online.


## Non-LiterALL

One argument that it has to be the same person is that the one called the disciple Jesus loved can't be John, or any of the "disciples" (see a problem already?) because Jesus and narrators of gospels say that all / each of the "disciples" scattered each to their own home, yet an anonymous disciple did follow Jesus, and helped Peter gain entrance to the courtyard of the high priest (I'll show the quote [later](#disciple-isnt-disciple)).

Example:

John 16:

/32  Behold, the time is coming, yes, and has now come, that **you will be scattered, <u><i>every</i></u>one to his own place, and you will leave me alone.** Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me./

First, although it's not my main point, how far do they need to be to qualify for "leave me alone"? I suggest they all scattered, and "left him alone," and perhaps eventually literally all went home separately (they may even have taken that part as instructions by that point), but in any case, my main argument allows for that this isn't literal.

The pro-Lazarus-as-DiLoved argument (which may vary) in this case appears to assume that "all" means literally all, in all cases -- or, perhaps, implies an argument that if it doesn't, we have a problem.

Not so, as I understand it.


### Say Again?

Hebrew "language culture" (how their culture used language, regardless of whether expressing their thoughts in Hebrew, Greek, or Aramaic or anything else) used *repetition* of "all" or synonyms to push toward a literal / universal all.

Notice in the verse I quoted above, Jesus only uses an "all" word once.

By default, this then should be seen as probably not absolute/literal, but that MOST of them would scatter and return to their homes.

It's true that we have more than one statement like this, but how close by do they need to be to indicate a literal-all?

(Or as I call it, a "literall".)

As we clearly see, "each to his own home" can't mean a literal all in this case (or at least not right away), at least not in any sense that would forbid this unnamed disciple from being John since John is one of the twelve, since Peter is also a disciple, by both the general definition and in the sense of one of the 12, and he also followed. In addition to this being said in John, it's said in Matthew too:

Matthew 26:

/56  But all this has happened that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.”

Then **all the disciples left him and fled.**

57 Those who had taken Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.

58 **But Peter followed him from a distance** to the court of the high priest, and entered in and sat with the officers, to see the end./

You can see here that by "all," Matthew clearly doesn't mean literally all.

If you didn't know before that Hebrew "language culture" has a non-literal-all, you should know it when you read this.

As we'll see [later](#disciple-isnt-disciple) from the gospel of John version of this, Peter and the "another disciple" in question are placed in parallel in terms of following Jesus, so this exception refers to two "disciples."


### Before You Flood Me With Objections

By contrast, we know for a standard example that "all" and synonyms are literal/absolute in the case of the extent of the Noahic Floodwaters by its over-over-over-repetition, including three direct synonyms of "all" (in bold below and underlined) and some other superlatives (italic and underlined) about the extent of the water (these will be all-capitalized), and many more about all land flesh dying outside the ark (I'll put the accumulating count for these in parentheses).

Genesis 6:

/13 God said to Noah, “I will bring an end to <u><b>all(1)</b></u> flesh, for the earth is filled with violence through them. Behold, I will destroy them and the earth.

...

17 I, even I, will bring the flood of waters on this earth, to destroy <u><b>all(2)</b></u> flesh having the breath of life from under the sky. <u><b>Every(3)</b></u>thing that is in the earth will die.

18 But I will establish my covenant with you. You shall come into the ship, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives with you. 19 Of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ship, to keep them alive with you. They shall be male and female./

(Keep in mind the listed exceptions don't change the otherwise universal nature of these statements, although that does mean they aren't literally all flesh under the sky dying. I'm not counting the "every" in 19 since that's about the exceptions. Also not counting the "alls" for Noah obeying, etc. Just about all flesh dying and the waters covering all land.)

7:

/4 In seven days, I will cause it to rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights. I will destroy <u><b>every(4)</b></u> living thing that I have made from the surface of the ground.”

...

17 The flood was forty days on the earth. The waters <u><i>INCREASED</i></u> and lifted up the ship, and it was lifted up above the earth. 18 The waters rose, and <u><i>INCREASED GREATLY,</i></u> on the earth; and the ship floated on the surface of the waters. 19 The waters rose <u><i>VERY</i></u> high on the earth./

Here LSB actually has /MORE and MORE/, which I confirmed in the interlinear just to be sure (מְאֹד מְאֹד, m^OHD m^OHD in my [Lingua](Lingua){:target="_blank"} transliteration system, with "^" being the unstressed uh of schwa, mᵊ'ōḏ mᵊ'ōḏ in BLB's transliteration), so what WEBP makes look like just one for /VERY/ is two.

/<u><b>ALL</b></u> the high mountains that were under the <u><b>WHOLE</b></u> sky were covered.

20 The waters rose fifteen cubits† higher, and the mountains were covered. 21 <u><b>All(5)</b></u> flesh died that moved on the earth, including birds, livestock, animals, <u><b>every(6)</b></u> creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and <u><b>every(7)</b></u> man.

22 <u><b>All(8)</b></u> on the dry land, in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, died./

LSB here has another all:

/Gen 7:22 - <u><b>All(8)</b></u> in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life—of <u><b>all(9)</b></u> that was on the dry land—died./

Back to WEBP (reluctantly):

/23 <u><b>Every(10)</b></u> living thing was destroyed that was on the surface of the ground, including man, livestock, creeping things, and birds of the sky. They were destroyed from the earth. <u><b>Only(11)</b></u> Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ship. 24 The waters flooded the earth one hundred fifty days./

8:

/9 but the dove found no place to rest her foot, and she returned into the ship to him, for the waters were on the surface of the <u><b>WHOLE</b></u> earth. He put out his hand, and took her, and brought her to him into the ship./

That's a total of three "alls" for water extent on land/earth, with four additional superlatives.

And an astonishing eleven "alls" for land flesh dying.

If I can count. Which is often in question.

(Depending on how little or much you know about origins, this may be good or bad news for you.

As a biblical creationist, I can understand that many will find the idea of a nonliteral all concerning, but ironically, the answer to how we know when it's literal actually backs up biblical creation and its interpretation of a global Flood much more than you might realize if you don't know how Hebrew "all"-language works.

The idea that "all means all" sounds great to our modern English culture, and often it does mean a literal all, but 1) it comes out of the effect on our culture of the industrial revolution (along with much of our general sense that literal = good and allowing for nonliteral is bad, because as one of JPH's sources says, \|machines tolerate no imprecision\|) and 2) even we don't actually follow that rule, as <u><b>every</b></u>one knows, so it's inconsistent to impose a rule on Hebrew culture that even we don't follow.

Careful with that plank! You could poke an eye out!

Some object that literal=good, and thus the Bible should rightly be held to a higher standard, but this is missing that the idea that literal is better, or that nonliteral is unclear and open to interpretation, is part of our culture, not ancient culture.

It's certainly true that ancients could struggle with this (we're looking at you, disciples when Jesus talked about the yeast of the Pharisees), but of course, the fact that Jesus spoke even more figuratively than many should clue you in that the higher standard may actually be to make your language a little bit more interesting from time to time, rather than a snorefest.

For the Christian Old-Earthers who worry the Bible gets disproven if it teaches a global Flood and "young" Earth, because secular scientists claim science disproves those, those claims are debunked in excruciating detail by AiG, CMI, ICR, CRS, etc. (See [end notes](#end-notes) on those.) I'll be eventually including articles about that on this site to clarify why I say that from my own perspective.)

This approach to language allows the Hebrew system to communicate clearly in any language -- including English or any other translation.

This shouldn't surprise us as the all-knowing God chose this language as the one for his original largest chosen culture which preserved his message to all humanity, and the language for that message to primarily be in, for OT.

God obviously foreknew we would be translating it into every language we could.

This is also similar to the rule about parallelism as usually implying equivalence or some other close relationship. This is a structure we can see in translation, although some lower-priority structures do get lost a bit like the common plays on words in Hebrew.

You also have to look at the logic flow, and proximity to other passages that may repeat the "all," in each case.

For example, what about this one?

6:

/22 Thus Noah did. He did all that God commanded him./

Did he do only most of what God commanded?

Well, a few verses later we have:

7:

/5 Noah did everything that Yahweh commanded him./

He didn't necessarily need to repeat it, but he does.

Notice this is all still the same basic section, so we should read these as most likely modifying each other. We know that because of the logic flow in this case.


### Paul's All

Paul himself talked about this principle here:

1st Corinthians 15:

/27 For, “He put all things in subjection under his feet.”*

But when he says, “All things are put in subjection”, it is evident that he is excepted who subjected all things to him.

28 When all things have been subjected to him, then the Son will also himself be subjected to him who subjected all things to him, that God may be all in all./


### He Is Not Just Talking About Bread

Some of Jesus' statements on legitimate exceptions for "work" on the Sabbath likely also apply, especially what he said here:

Mark 2:

/23 He was going on the Sabbath day through the grain fields; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of grain.

24 The Pharisees said to him, “Behold, why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day?”

25 He said to them, “Did you never read what David did when he had need and was hungry—he, and those who were with him?

26  How he entered into God’s house at the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the show bread, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and gave also to those who were with him?”

27 He said to them, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. 28  Therefore the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.”/

This was referring to [1 Samuel 21:1-6](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/1sa/21/1){:target="_blank"}.

For his own disciples in the present, this was probably at least partially about that he was instituting the new covenant predicted by Moses. (Details below.)

But about David, it's about how the implied "all" in all (all) didactic law (the legal genre that all all all ancient law was in, including the Law of Moses) isn't necessarily literal and depended on all (all) the other laws in it, in full full full context in the Mosaic Law, and would be determined on a case by case basis by the judges.

This is why the law was given, evidently, immediately after the setting up of the judge heirarchy. (See Exodus 18, where Jethro advises this, then 19 where the law begins to be revealed.)

The idea that exceptions always need to be explicitly spelled out up front is a modern one, so the objection is anachronistic. Social scientist Bruce Malina has documented this in detail (see for example his *Handbook of Biblical Social Values*, a must-read source recommended by JPH (see abbreviations list in end notes)).

For the part about Jesus' application to his disciples as Lord of the Sabbath, see here:

Deuteronomy 18:

/5 Yahweh your God will raise up to you a prophet from among you, of your brothers, like me. You shall listen to him. 16 This is according to all that you desired of Yahweh your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, “Let me not hear again Yahweh my God’s voice, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I not die.”

17 Yahweh said to me, “They have well said that which they have spoken. 18 I will raise them up a prophet from among their brothers, like you. I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him. 19 It shall happen, that whoever will not listen to my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him./

This was where Moses, passing on God's words, "spoke of" Jesus, as Jesus said he did.

That he was predicting a new covenant might be a bit subtle, but establishing a covenant was what Moses did (the Mosaic covenant) so that's implied in the "like me."

Also in the "listen to him." Basically this means when Christ came, it would be his prerogative to establish a new covenant, or not to, however God chose, and whether it would continue with the Mosaic one (as a branch off of it, as all previous covenants had been branches off of the previous (Adamic, Noahic, Abrahamic, then Mosaic), except arguably a replacement Adamic one when Adam and Eve sinned), or else replace it (as clearly it did, as a branch off of the Abrahamic, which the Mosaic also branched off of, which Paul makes clear in [Galatians 3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gal/3){:target="_blank"}, especially verse 25 in context).

That it would indeed be a new covenant was explicitly confirmed here, as well as that it would not be a branch off of the Mosaic covenant:

Jeremiah 31:

/31 “Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah,

32 not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, which covenant of mine they broke, although I was a husband to them,” says Yahweh.

33 “But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days,” says Yahweh:

“I will put my law in their inward parts,

and I will write it in their heart.

I will be their God,<br>
and they shall be my people.

34 They will no longer each teach his neighbor,<br>
and every man teach his brother, saying, ‘Know Yahweh;’<br>
for they will all know me,<br>
from their least to their greatest,” says Yahweh,<br>
“for I will forgive their iniquity,<br>
and I will remember their sin no more.”/

By beginning to establish new rules for the ceremonial aspects of life like how to behave on the Sabbath, Jesus was hinting that he was the Christ, Son of God (as many other passages made it clear the Messiah would be God, beyond the scope of this article, but planned for others later). So he was initiating the New Covenant, after which the New Testament is named (Testament means Covenant).

Obviously, David was before this, so Jesus' point was not that Jesus was simply suspending the law as God beforehand, though he could do that too. His point is about how the law always worked, and this includes its "all" statements.

JPH has more material on this including historical evidence that this is how it was interpreted.


### Christ is the Creator, Not the Created

This rule about how "all"-language works in Hebrew language culture (including when expressed in Greek) is part of why we know Jesus had no beginning.

This is contary to a popular Unitarian view (of some variants I've seen, though some seem to vary on this) that Jesus was simply the first created being, otherwise very similar to the Trinitarian view but just as a lesser being, like a super-angel.

Since we're focusing on John here, let's just restrict this to the early examples there.

John 1:

/1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 The same was in the beginning with God.

3 <u><b>All</b></u> things were made through him. Without him, <u><b>no</b></u>thing was made that has been made. 4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men./

So far this is only two, but that may be enough to confirm it's literal, and the grammar and the rest of this is making that clear; the phrase "that has been made" is there to clarify that Jesus isn't a thing made. Not just "no thing has been made without him," but specifically no thing was made without him that *has* been made.

In other words, he wasn't made.

Unitarians have various ways to claim they can get out of the "and the Word was God," of course, that don't work. But that in addition to "the same was in the beginning with God," which is also a repetition of "and the Word was with God" is also implying an absolute. I didn't underline it because it's technically not a direct absolute word; it's implying the meaning of one. But it makes it very clear. And we're far from done here:

/5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasn’t overcome† it.

6 There came a man sent from God, whose name was John. 7 The same came as a witness, that he might testify about the light, that all might believe through him. 8 He was not the light, but was sent that he might testify about the light.

9 The true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world./

This is shown by JPH (see abbreviations list at end, and read his "Wisdom Theology" article, and also his Holy Spirit article) as being an allusion to God's Wisdom. This is just one such of many similar examples in the NT, where the NT authors put Jesus in place of sayings that in the OT, and the extra-biblical IT (which don't need to be part of the Bible for the NT to make a point using allusions to that literature), had Wisdom in the same constructions. This about "light that enlightens" is one such.

Recently a prominent Unitarian, Sean Finnegan, who you might find if you google Unitarianism because he often comes up in such searches, was forced to admit that the Bible teaches that Jesus is the personification of God's Wisdom.

Without realizing it, he was admitting to the biblical Trinitarian model, which defines the "Personhood" of Jesus as being the beginninglessly, literally personified Wisdom of God, but simply denying the beginningless part.

He doesn't realize that this is what being a "distinct but inseparable" "Person" means, but it is.

(Finnegan claims not to see the distinction between distinction and separation. This is the distinction! Jesus obviously cannot be separated from God if he literally *is* God's Wisdom. If you separate God's Wisdom from God, what does that turn God into? You can have a finite mere representation of His Wisdom, to be fair, and as a personification, he is in a sense a representation, similar to what Hebrews 1 says, but John (the gospel) is here saying that's not all that Jesus is.)

/10 He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world didn’t recognize him. 11 He came to his own, and those who were his own didn’t receive him. 12 But as many as received him, to them he gave the right to become God’s children, to those who believe in his name: 13 who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.

14 The Word became flesh and lived among us. We saw his glory, such glory as of the <u><b>only</b></u> born‡ Son of the Father, full of grace and truth.

15 John testified about him. He cried out, saying, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me has surpassed me, for he was before me.’ ” 16 From his fullness we all received grace upon grace. 17 For the law was given through Moses. Grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ.§

18 <u><b>No</b></u> one has seen God at any time. The <u><b>only</b></u> born† Son,‡ who is in the bosom of the Father, has declared him./

Some might be confused about "born" -- a common bad argument is that it implies being created, but birth is not the beginning of a human, so they're getting the analogy wrong. Something can be brought forth at a point in time, without having a beginning before it. This means when he entered the creation because it was being created. It has nothing to do with having a beginning; the other passages around it are in fact explicitly saying he doesn't!

Yes, humans, of course, have beginnings, but at that point you're pushing the analogy too far, into territory we call the fallacy of analogy.

The exclusive language is also saying that Jesus is to the Father what no created being is.

This is also saying he's uncreated.

And we have quite a bit of repetition here. Not as much about all land flesh dying in the Flood, but this is sufficient that if in fact Jesus is *not* God, John would be intentionally pushing toward saying he is, *without clarifying otherwise,* which would be blasphemy.

While argument from silence can be fallacious, this is argument from glaring silence. As long as the glaring-ness is logically correct, based on strong evidence (that isn't silent), it actually becomes a strong point.

(Thus the fallacy really should be called argument from non-glaring silence, but often of course those who use it will pretend that silence that logically isn't surprising is actually surprising if they're wrong. This is especially common with biblioskeptical pseudoscholars like Bart Ehrman for example.)


### All Testable Contradiction Claims Are Debunked

I've personally investigated now over 1000 claimed Bible contradictions, and literally not one has stood as a legitimate contradiction.

Inductively at this point it's plausible to conclude there are none.

I should have found some if it's just manmade.

Many, many of the bad arguments for Bible contradictions depend on the assumption that "all" is always literal.

If you don't follow apologetics much it might not seem that relevant, but it's very relevant. It's extremely significant that a fully logical understanding of the entire biblical text, and of the world around us, make complete sense together when we follow the rules of the biblical source languages and culture to properly intepret the text using sound hermeneutics science.

The rule about "all" isn't light speculation, or speculation at all.

It's beyond the scope of this article, which will be extremely long, to go over many examples but suffice to say this is a major focus you can read about extensively from JPH/GM (see end notes).

JPH's standard example diffusing many claimed contradictions related to "all" is where Jesus is said to have taught his disciples "all" things.

Clearly it doesn't mean teaching them obscure modern trivia or telling them the number of grains of sand on Israel's Mediterranean shore, etc.

Example of JPH pointing this out:

\|1 Corinthians 13:7
Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. One Skeptic quotes the "believeth" part against verses that say to test things, and others may wonder whether this is an admonition against thinking critically. Our answer calls upon an application from elsewhere: "All things" is a general phrase of proverbial hyperbole; it is to be taken no more as exclusive than the idea that Jesus in Mark expounded "all things" (including the habits of sea slugs?) to his disciples. 1 Cor. 13:7 may be taken as a piece with the likewise proverbial admonition in 1 Thess. 5:21 to prove all things. (Does that include gravity and star mass ratios?)\|


### Poetry Justifies No Such Thing

One last point on that topic. A common modern objection to the idea that the Bible contains poetry (especially if it dares show its face in historical narrative, especially for we biblical creationists) is that poetry is intended to be unclear and opens it up to personal interpretation.

The precise opposite is generally the case of Hebrew poetry, and the rules of Hebrew poetry are a way to often be as clear as, in some cases even more clear than, literal speech. It just depends on the situation.

Examples of poetry legitimately being less clear to them abound in the disciples and the general public struggling to understand Jesus' parables, but as he said about it:

Mark 4:

/13 He said to them, “Don’t you understand this parable? How will you understand all of the parables?

14  The farmer sows the word. 15  The ones by the road are the ones where the word is sown; and when they have heard, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word which has been sown in them. 16  These in the same way are those who are sown on the rocky places, who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy. 17  They have no root in themselves, but are short-lived. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they stumble. 18  Others are those who are sown among the thorns. These are those who have heard the word, 19  and the cares of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. 20  Those which were sown on the good ground are those who hear the word, accept it, and bear fruit, some thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times.”

21 He said to them, “Is a lamp brought to be put under a basket ‡ or under a bed? Isn’t it put on a stand? 22  For there is nothing hidden except that it should be made known, neither was anything made secret but that it should come to light. 23  If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.”/

There is nothing hidden in Jesus' parables but that it should come to light.

He clearly *expects* you to be able to follow the rules to deduce what he meant, at least in general (do keep in mind nonliterall means not necessarily literally all poetic devices in the Bible will become crystal clear in this life, such as some in Revelation).

I've seen people go way, way, way overboard with the idea that they're supposed to understand, to be fair. You know the types if you read online internet comments to long. But they get their crazy ideas because they aren't reading the whole thing in context, they make a claim, rather than TEST the hypothesis to see if it's really true. They just run with it, full of arrogance.

There's all kinds of ways to err, but going too far in avoiding the errors of that type is itself an error, and throwing all poetry under the bus is a fool's errand.

You can see in many cases that even when Jesus is speaking to outsiders, he is drawing comparisons to help vividly teach an important lesson, such as here:

Matthew 11:

/13  For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John. 14  If you are willing to receive it, this is Elijah, who is to come. 15  He who has ears to hear, let him hear.

16  “But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, who call to their companions 17  and say, ‘We played the flute for you, and you didn’t dance. We mourned for you, and you didn’t lament.’ 18  For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon.’ 19  The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ But wisdom is justified by her children.”‡/

And:

Luke 13:

/18 He said, “What is God’s Kingdom like? To what shall I compare it? 19  It is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and put in his own garden. It grew and became a large tree, and the birds of the sky live in its branches.”

20 Again he said, “To what shall I compare God’s Kingdom? 21  It is like yeast, which a woman took and hid in three measures † of flour, until it was all leavened.”/

And in some cases even the outsiders got the point:

Matthew 21:

/23 When he had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, “By what authority do you do these things? Who gave you this authority?”

24 Jesus answered them, “I also will ask you one question, which if you tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things. 25  The baptism of John, where was it from? From heaven or from men?”

They reasoned with themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask us, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’ 26 But if we say, ‘From men,’ we fear the multitude, for all hold John as a prophet.”

27 They answered Jesus, and said, “We don’t know.”

He also said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.

28  But what do you think?

A man had two sons, and he came to the first, and said, ‘Son, go work today in my vineyard.’

29  He answered, ‘I will not,’ but afterward he changed his mind, and went.

30  He came to the second, and said the same thing.

He answered, ‘I’m going, sir,’ but he didn’t go.

31  Which of the two did the will of his father?”

They said to him, “The first.”

Jesus said to them, “Most certainly I tell you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering into God’s Kingdom before you. 32  For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you didn’t believe him; but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. When you saw it, you didn’t even repent afterward, that you might believe him./

Here they clearly understand his point, and he made it *more* clear via poetry.

And then immediately after it in the same chapter, that happens again:

/33  “Hear another parable. There was a man who was a master of a household who planted a vineyard, set a hedge about it, dug a wine press in it, built a tower, leased it out to farmers, and went into another country.

34  When the season for the fruit came near, he sent his servants to the farmers to receive his fruit.

35  The farmers took his servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned another.

36  Again, he sent other servants more than the first; and they treated them the same way.

37  But afterward he sent to them his son, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’

38  But the farmers, when they saw the son, said among themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him and seize his inheritance.’ 39  So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard, then killed him. 40  When therefore the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those farmers?”

41 They told him, “He will miserably destroy those miserable men, and will lease out the vineyard to other farmers who will give him the fruit in its season.”

42 Jesus said to them, “Did you never read in the Scriptures,
‘The stone which the builders rejected
was made the head of the corner.
This was from the Lord.
It is marvelous in our eyes’?*

43  “Therefore I tell you, God’s Kingdom will be taken away from you and will be given to a nation producing its fruit. 44  He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but on whomever it will fall, it will scatter him as dust.”

45 When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke about them./

Another obvious example from the OT:

2nd Samuel 12:

/1 Yahweh sent Nathan to David.

He came to him, and said to him, “There were two men in one city: the one rich, and the other poor. 2 The rich man had very many flocks and herds, 3 but the poor man had nothing, except one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and raised.

It grew up together with him and with his children. It ate of his own food, drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was like a daughter to him.

4 A traveler came to the rich man, and he didn’t want to take of his own flock and of his own herd to prepare for the wayfaring man who had come to him, but took the poor man’s lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him.”

5 David’s anger burned hot against the man, and he said to Nathan, “As Yahweh lives, the man who has done this deserves to die! 6 He must restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing and because he had no pity!”

7 Nathan said to David, “You are the man!

This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: ‘I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul. 8 I gave you your master’s house and your master’s wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that would have been too little, I would have added to you many more such things. 9 Why have you despised Yahweh’s word, to do that which is evil in his sight? You have struck Uriah the Hittite with the sword, have taken his wife to be your wife, and have slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon. 10 Now therefore the sword will never depart from your house, because you have despised me and have taken Uriah the Hittite’s wife to be your wife.’

11 “This is what Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house; and I will take your wives before your eyes and give them to your neighbor, and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun. 12 For you did this secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.’ ”

13 David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against Yahweh.”

Nathan said to David, “Yahweh also has put away your sin. You will not die. 14 However, because by this deed you have given great occasion to Yahweh’s enemies to blaspheme, the child also who is born to you will surely die.” 15 Then Nathan departed to his house./

The point was *clearer* to David because it was delivered by poetry -- even David's initial lack of understanding the metaphor was a tool used for highly effective communication, and cutting through what would have been a serious emotional barrier if Nathan had just said directly, "You have sinned against Yahweh. You did this and that regarding Bathsheba and Uriah. BAD King! BAD!"

David likely would have been immediately defensive about it.

And in any case, the delivery is much more memorable and cuts to the heart.

As for concerns about poetic devices in historical narration, while it can, with limited data, be misunderstood, in general they're actually easier to understand in translation than many modern metaphors would be if you didn't know the cultural context, ironically enough since biblical culture was high-context and we're (dramatically) low-context (in the "West").

Such as throwing people under the bus, etc. We're much less properly inventive with them, though, because we're so low-context, we're stuck as walking cliches, and not the funny Colonel Jack O'Neill type.

Literal statements, though, can also be misunderstood, if you don't know the meanings of the words. Poetic *comparisons* can in many cases actually help clarify the meanings.

And we also today have newscasters and the like who often throw in new puns (I won't call them innovative) that we have no trouble understanding even though they aren't necessarily in our normal repertoire, and we don't suddenly worry that the entire news report might be open to wild reinterpretation.


## Disciple isn't Disciple?

Another obvious problem with the "it can't be John because he's a disciple and all the disciples went home" argument is that, well, the phrase in question is the *disciple* Jesus loved.

This argument works from this passage:

John 18:

/12 So the detachment, the commanding officer, and the officers of the Jews seized Jesus and bound him, 13 and led him to Annas first, for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. 14 Now it was Caiaphas who advised the Jews that it was expedient that one man should perish for the people.

15 Simon Peter followed Jesus, as did another disciple.

Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest; 16 but Peter was standing at the door outside.

So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought in Peter./

This doesn't include the "loved" part, but it does include the anonymity, oddness of the anonymity (occasional references to various unnamed disciples aren't necessarily surprising, but this one is emphasized and the wording used a few times here), and, obviously, the word "disciple."

Parsimoniously, this is the same one referred to by the DiLoved phrase in the incident with the dipping of bread, and in the final chapter of John.

Now I find this argument *somewhat plausible,* because there can be two senses of "disciple."

A common error is thinking that one word always has one meaning only, or that if it doesn't it's a problem. No.

It *would* make sense to me that the "disciple" here (and perhaps the bread-dipping case, but not the final chapter of John) could be Lazarus. We see that the word can be used in a general sense of any follower of Christ, and Christian:

John 8:

/31 Jesus therefore said to those Jews who had believed him, “If you remain in my word, then you are truly my disciples./

The Bible often switches between senses of words. It was normal practice and a sign of a worthy wordsmith to switch between them in close proximity without spelling out that the meaning of the word was shifting, and rely on the intelligent reader to see the difference.

This was part of how the wisdom teacher would sort the fool from the wise student.

Like, I like the like count like I liked them all myself as the likeness of alike likers.

Here, it would be that when Jesus and narrators say "all disciples" scattered, they mean all among the 12 only, but that Lazarus can be a disciple in a more general sense.

That specific argument itself I have no problem with, so far as it alone goes, but it becomes a problem in these two ways beyond just itself:

First, when we simultaneously think that "all" disciples scattering rules out the 12, because we can't allow "all" to also have multiple senses. This is inconsistent reasoning.

Second, if we argue that this somehow implies this disciple can't be John.

If Lazarus can be the "disciple" who accompanied Peter (and, to be fair, he can in terms of whether he might have been there in Gethsemane; most likely it wasn't just the 12; I think Mark was the anonymous young man who fled in Mark, for example), and the one at the Last Supper (I'm less sure Lazarus can be this one at time of writing this paragraph), then he can be among the disciples told they would "all" scatter, and especially in Matthew would be among the ones near Peter who Matthew says "all" scattered, according to John 18:15 (quoted above).

So the argument, while valid, actually goes nowhere.


### Known to the high priest?

Another argument is that Lazarus is a better candidate than John to be known to the high priest (see passage quote in above section).

John was "just" a fisherman.

True, although to use this as an argument seems dubious; even if we grant for sake of argument that he's just as normal a mere fisherman as every other fisherman, and that this would mean that in that status alone, he can't be known to the high priest, why can't he become known to him in some sense later like knowing he's one of Jesus' inner circle?

But let's grant it all for now, for sake of argument. Caiphas is simply hopelessly uninformed, and he only knows Lazarus because connections and Lazarus lived nearby, we'll say.

Then there's a bit of a problem:

John 12:

/9 A large crowd therefore of the Jews learned that he was there; and they came, not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.

10 But the chief priests conspired to put Lazarus to death also, 11 because on account of him many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus./

Let's assume that Lazarus didnt flee Judea due to this, although I've heard it said that extrabiblical sources may claim or imply he did.

Even if not, he probably knew this, so would hardly risk going even within a guarded gate right to the very people trying to kill him.

It might be argued that whoever recorded this only found it out later, but the wording of "but" here seems to imply to me that it was known at the time and that Lazarus at least was trying to lay low.

That's also consistent with the type of culture they were, where everybody essentially told everybody everything about everybody all of the time. JPH's social science sources have much to say on this.

The Bible does record some cases of the general public knowing about intent to kill Jesus:

John 7:

/25 Therefore some of them of Jerusalem said, “Isn’t this he whom they seek to kill? 26 Behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the Christ?/

Although to be fair, they might have gotten that idea from Jesus himself:

John 7 (a few verses earlier):

/19  Didn’t Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me?”

20 The multitude answered, “You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?”/

Still, it looks like the author is saying that the people did know that they really were trying to kill them; that they already knew that before Jesus said that.

Earlier in the chapter, it was mentioned that Jesus knew this too, though of course he may have known that only through his omniscience. But in general it seems clear to me that this was common knowledge.

It's also possible for Jesus to warn Lazarus about the plot on his life too.

So regardless of whether Lazarus was known to the high priest, it seems highly unlikely that right during the arrest of Jesus himself, that Lazarus would risk going right to the same people who did that.

Far more likely it's a "lower target."

But Peter shows that he "feels the heat" (so to speak, in the cold, while trying to stay warm by the fire), so all the more, Lazarus would, when Peter denies Christ three times (specifically denies being a "disciple" of him, ironically, in John's wording in John 18:17,25, then denies being in Gethsemane in 26-27), as Christ foretold he would.

That this unnamed disciple who is known to the high priest is only mentioned in John (the gospel), and the identity of the fisherman DiLoved with the Last Supper DiLoved (read on) makes it clear that anonymity and the word "disciple" are the author's mark, and all the evidence that the author is John (again read on for deets), makes it highly likely that this is the author expressing his own perspective.

Note again how detailed it is about specifically who moved where when:

John 18:

/15 Simon Peter followed Jesus, as did another disciple.

Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest; 16 but Peter was standing at the door outside.

So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought in Peter.

17 Then the maid who kept the door said to Peter, “Are you also one of this man’s disciples?”

He said, “I am not.”

18 Now the servants and the officers were standing there, having made a fire of coals, for it was cold.

They were warming themselves.

Peter was with them, standing and warming himself./

And it goes on like this. This is clear authorial POV.

This unnamed disciple continues to be here -- he doesn't disappear -- and likely remains with Jesus the whole time, a little distant, likely literally so that Jesus is "alone" but such as at the back of the crowd in the "trials", or some of them (probably not with Pilate though, although specific reports of where Pilate walked are included, so probably nearby), and is then the one at the cross who is told that Mary, mother of Jesus, is now his mother to take care of, and he her son.

John 19:

/25 But standing by Jesus’ cross were his mother, his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.

26 Therefore when Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother, “Woman, behold, your son!”

27 Then he said to the disciple, “Behold, your mother!” From that hour, the disciple took her to his own home./

Note here that "the disciple whom he loved" is placed in parallel with "the disciple." That can be just normal shortening for the second reference, but it might also comment back on "the disciple" earlier who came with Peter to the courtyard, and this is almost certainly the same one here.

Since DiLoved is, again almost certainly, the apostle John per logic from the final chapter of the gospel, this is John. And so the disciple who was known to the high priest, Caiaphas, is John.

Why?

Why would Caiaphas know a fisherman?

Well, for a moment, let's drop our earlier for-sake-of-argument concession that somehow Caiaphas doesn't know who the inner circle of disciples are who are always there when this Jesus guy is being a thorn in his side. He could simply know that John has interest in what happens to Jesus. And that Nicodemus has no influence here, or any of the others like him.

Now let's pick up that odd concession we made, though.

In a worst-case scenario where the only explanation can be tied to John as he was before Jesus called him, a fisherman from Galilee, I still see several possibilities.

First, John and James were of a fisherman family. This makes it possible they were a somewhat successful one. Any success at all is possible to open up connections to elites like Caiaphas. The same idea is used to suggest how Lazarus might be known to him, although Lazarus lived much closer.

Second, we can't rule out a family connection without data to the contrary. Some uncle of John's might be a local synagogue leader who might have some connection to Caiphas, or to the Jerusalem leadership in general.

Third, what does "known to the high priest" mean specifically and how do we know?

Does it mean Caiaphas personally knew him?

Not necessarily, due to the cultural language rule of embedding.


### Embodying Embedding in Body

Embedding refers to the common linguistic practice of referring to everybody under a leader as if they are that leader.

We see embedding with the parallel passages about the centurion here:

Matthew 8:

/5 When he came into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking him for help, 6 saying, “Lord, my servant lies in the house paralyzed, grievously tormented.”

7 Jesus said to him, “I will come and heal him.”

8 The centurion answered, “Lord, I’m not worthy for you to come under my roof. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed. 9 For I am also a man under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and tell another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and tell my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”

10 When Jesus heard it, he marveled and said to those who followed, “Most certainly I tell you, I haven’t found so great a faith, not even in Israel. 11  I tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven, 12  but the children of the Kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”

13 Jesus said to the centurion, “Go your way. Let it be done for you as you have believed.” His servant was healed in that hour./

Matthew is condensing the details that don't matter as much for the sake of the audience, drawing their attention to the key aspects of this event, but Luke gives more directly literal detail:

Luke 7:

/1 After he had finished speaking in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum. 2 A certain centurion’s servant, who was dear to him, was sick and at the point of death.

3 When he heard about Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and save his servant.

4 When they came to Jesus, they begged him earnestly, saying, “He is worthy for you to do this for him, 5 for he loves our nation, and he built our synagogue for us.”

6 Jesus went with them.

When he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, “Lord, don’t trouble yourself, for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof. 7 Therefore I didn’t even think myself worthy to come to you; but say the word, and my servant will be healed.

8 For I also am a man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”

9 When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned and said to the multitude who followed him, “I tell you, I have not found such great faith, no, not in Israel.”

10 Those who were sent, returning to the house, found that the servant who had been sick was well./

(This is on the populist ignorant skeptics' lists of supposed Bible contradictions, of course. Embedding is the answer.)

Embedding would, in fact, be the default expected meaning people would expect is being implied even if nobody like Luke had ever let the rest of us in on the figure of speech.

This is likely one example of a difference in initial intended audience.

We have ancient testimony that Matthew wrote originally a "Hebrew" gospel (perhaps meaning writing in Aramaic, but it may have literally meant Hebrew), and that someone (maybe Matthew himself) later translated it to Greek. Matthew is also Hebrew himself, so he may have taken it more for granted how this figure works, while Luke is thought to have been more Hellenistic, so he may have had in mind more of writing for wider audiences.

Embedding is also seen here:

1st Corinthians 12:

/27 Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually./

And the previous verses starting at 12.


### A Man's Gotta Eat

Life works by you work for food. You farm, or you fish, or you hunt, or you gather, or you produce lab-grown meat that probably causes cancer.

Or else, you work in some kind of indirect support work for this, or for providing shelter, or amenities, or else you're an elite, and you work at some unrelated task, and those who obtain money (the "certificate that you served your fellow man") get their food from someone else -- whether directly from a food producer, or from a food distribution worker or workers.

If the idea is that a chief priest would not associate with a fisherman (which will be a problematic argument for saying DiLoved is Lazarus as it is, since the final chapter of John places DiLoved trying to fish all night with Peter etc.), or a farmer, or a hunter, or a gatherer... or a food distributor...

That may very well be so in the sense of Caiaphas himself, but once we understand embedding, we understand that servants of Caiaphas, of the temple, etc., provide him and the other elites with food.

Or else you very quickly would not have elites.

Notice again this wording:

John 18:

/16 but Peter was standing at the door outside. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought in Peter.

17 Then the maid who kept the door said to Peter, “Are you also one of this man’s disciples?”

He said, “I am not.”/

It seems like she who kept the door, a maid, knows this unnamed disciple.

I think the wording is more like that John arrived first (seems this is a thing about which of the two of them arrives first to places, as seen with who arrived first at the tomb), and told the maid that he had interest to know the outcome of what was happening concerning Jesus, because he was a disciple.

That would explain her word choice to Peter (read it just above again).

But if not, then it seems that she didn't need someone of higher authority to come back and say it was okay to let Peter in too; it seems like she knew the Unnamed Disciple should be allowed through the door and could be trusted to say who else should be allowed through.

This could simply be because someone who served food to Caiaphas knew John, or his father, or his brother, etc.

While they lived in very different places, that could easily happen.

It could also be that this is condensing that someone else did go and tell her that Unnamed Disciple's permission should stand, but this just shuffles around the same point. It would be normal in embedding too.


## Backwards Statistics Fallacy (or Error)

"Backwards Statistics" fallacy is my term for a type of error I see often but have struggled to find already listed on popular lists of fallacies, but it's closely related to a type of fallacy called fallacy of composition.

I typically refer to fallacies I've noticed but that aren't on popular lists as "errors" rather than fallacies when I don't have time to explain, to help imply that it's my own observation not to be found on others' lists, so keep that in mind, but it's a specific type of error that is fallacious.

While it's true that it's unlikely for Caiaphas to know any one *particular* fisherman, the argument that he thus can't known John is false. Statistically, when you consider the group of all fishermen, the opposite is the case; it's highly *likely* that every elite knows *someone* who isn't elite, and that includes non-elites from the fisherman category.

The only way to know *which* non-elites are known by the elites is reporting.

Given all the evidence showing that the "disciple" who Caiaphas knew was the author of the gospel of John, and (as we'll look at more later here), that author is John, we have the historical report that John is one of the non-elites who Caiaphas "knew" in some sense (or a servant of his did).

That should be enough for us; anything else is fallacious.

Let's delve into why.

In logic, we have something crucial called the Square of Opposition.

We have four types of corners to the Square:

1: "All" of some thing (let's call it S, for the subject of a sentence, as is standard) is some other thing (P for predicate of the sentence)

Any type of statement that can be legitimately paraphrased as "All S is P" (using S and P a bit like algebra variables, plugging in other things in place of them) is called an "A" type of premise.

My mnemonic for this is that "A affirms."

(S affirms P.)

(The four vowels used to label the square don't come from English words, so might be a bit counterintuitive other than the "All" case.)

2: No S is P = E-Type.

My mnemonic: E excludes.

(S excludes P.)

A and E (all and none; mnemonic affirms and excludes) are "universal" types of premises. Keep that term in mind; this is key here to why we have a fallacy with the argument that John "can't" be the disciple known to Caiaphas.

3: Some S is P = I-Type.

Mnemonic: I includes.

(S includes P.)

4: Some S is not P = O-Type.

Mnemonic: O outlies.

(S outlies P.)

I and O are "particular" types of premises.

If we affirm a particular premise, typically it is taken as confirming the real existence of at least one member. ("Some S is P" implies at least one member of S does exist.) While "all S is P" (A-type; affirms) is not taken as implying any S actually exist.

Our fallacy is arguing wrongly from O (Some S is not P) to E (No S is P.)

That is:

Some fishermen are not known to Caiaphas.

Therefore no fishermen are known to Caiaphas.

(And then, since John is a fisherman, therefore John is not known to Caiaphas. Ignore the problem that DiLoved spent a whole night fishing in John 21.)

Specifically it is a subtype of what I call "parts fallacy" -- the general category of fallacies that wrongly claim that what applies to a part of a whole applies to the whole, or vice versa. This subtype is which argues from a MOST to an ALL, or at least from a MOST to a LARGER MOST, without warrant.

Warrant could be if we had a statement where Caiaphas is on record saying, "I know no fishermen, and none of my servants know any either."

(Of course, that also doesn't disprove John, since we don't actually agree that it doesn't mean that Caiaphas, or she who governs the door, or anybody else knows John is a disciple of Jesus, so had interest to be let in for Jesus' trial. Plus Caiaphas could be lying, or using hyperbole, but it would at least be evidence pushing against John.)

Here's the list of main examples I see a lot or otherwise are important main categories to understand the types of "parts fallacies:"

- **Parts fallacy (or error):** My term for the whole category of both the fallacies of composition and division. (**Arguing from particular to universal or from universal to particular, or any combination** of those, **including from particular to majority, minority to majority, majority to minority, etc.**)

- **Composition fallacy:** "Something true of a part is true of the whole." **(Particular to universal.)** Backwards Statistics would be a subtype of this, as are the others below other than Division. This can include positive **(some, to all)** or negative **(some not, to none)**.

  Example of Composition Fallacy: "Metal doesn't float, so the metal boat doesn't float."

  "<u>Met</u>al doesn't <u>float</u>,<br>
  "<u>So</u> a metal <u>boat</u>,<br>
  "<u>Simp</u>ly doesn't <u>float</u>."

- **Division fallacy:** "Something true of a whole is true of a part." **(Universal to particular.)**

  Example of Division Fallacy: "The metal boat floats, so a piece of metal from the boat will float on its own too."
  
  "The <u>met</u>al boat <u>floats</u>;<br>
  "A <u>piece</u> of the <u>boat</u>,<br>
  "Will <u>tot</u>ally <u>float</u>!"

- **Hasty Generalization:** "One (or a few) cases prove a majority (or a universal)." Also *Anecdotal evidence* or *Faulty Generalization.* **(One or a few, to most or all.)** I call it **HastyGen** for short.

  It's true that when you first encounter of an example of something within a set, it's most likely that you have encountered a typical example.
  
  I think this sense is why people fall for this error, but this should motivate us not to lazily leap to conclusions based on it, but to be aware of, and plan for, the potential for it to be typical.

  And then if it matters, motivate you to do research more widely, and find out if it really is.

  And why; why is that feature or trait true in that case, or in however many cases it is, and how can you *actually* tell which cases it will be true of?

  So learn to test for what really indicates a thing.

  That lesson applies to all of these fallacies/errors, of course.

  Example of Hasty Generalization Fallacy: "I saw a metal boat. All boats have thus always been metal. Or at least most! So the boat Jesus was on when he calmed the storm? Probably metal."
  
  "I <u>saw</u> a metal <u>boat</u>.<br>
  "Of <u>this</u> I thus took <u>note</u>,<br>
  "Though <u>it's</u> an anec<u>dote</u>:<br>

  "When you <u>read</u> about <u>boats</u>,<br>
  "They are <u>met</u>al then, <u>totes</u>.<br>
  "Or at <u>least</u> true for <u>most</u>.<br>

  "When a <u>storm</u> Christ made <u>dust</u>,<br>
  "On a <u>boat</u>, then, it <u>must</u>,<br>
  "Be <u>quite</u> prone to <u>rust</u>."

- **Overconfident Extrapolation:** "A pattern found in most cases with limited data, will (or will most likely) apply to other cases." **(Pattern in one or a few, to pattern in most or all.)**

  Example of Overconfident Extrapolation Fallacy: "I've noticed metal boats tend to be used for work purposes like commercial fishing or shipping of goods. Probably this pattern extends back through all history, so the boat Peter wanted to go fishing on in John 21? Totes metal."

   "I have <u>not</u>iced a <u>patt</u>ern,<br>
   "So my <u>doubts</u> have been <u>scatt</u>erned,<br>
   "For shipping <u>goods</u> or for <u>fish</u>ing,<br>
   "For metal <u>boats</u> you'd be <u>wish</u>ing.

   "Twenty-oneth <u>chap</u>ter of <u>John</u>,<br>
   "When Peter a <u>boat</u> he went <u>on</u>,<br>
   "It <u>prob</u>'ly wasn't <u>plast</u>ic,<br>
   "Or <u>wood</u> or e<u>last</u>ic."

- **Overgeneralization:** Whereas HastyGen argues from a potential minority (or very small minority) to a plurality (what approaches a majority) or a majority or universal, overgeneralization *might* argue from a *majority* (or a plurality) to a higher majority (such as a vast majority) or to a universal. **(More, to most or all.)**

  This one is essentially Backwards Statistics, but Backwards Statistics has a slightly different emphasis that's more relevant to why overgeneralization is wrong and shows that the specific type of use of it is actually self-refuting.
  
  Overgeneralization can be plausible evidentially as a likelihood argument, but is fallacious if it's treated as a guarantee, and even likelihood arguments can push to far.

  The reason I like to have a specific term for the self-refuting type of overgeneralization is that if you just reply to the use of the self-refuting type with "that's an overgeneralization," people will emotionally (often) assume it's a weak response to a strong argument they made, while acknowledging that their argument isn't absolutely proven.

  The precise opposite is the case when it's the specific type of overgeneralization I'm talking about; they made an extremely weak argument, and it's best for the reply to make that initially very clear (politely if you can manage that).

  Example of Overgeneralization Fallacy: "Ancients usually didn't float babies down rivers in baskets, so the Moses adoption story by the Egyptian princess is probably false. They would have used a metal box. Way easier to waterproof."

  Must I really try to make a poem for that? I started above because I noticed the first example I gave almost rhymed with almost matching meter.

  Well I <u>think</u> less than <u>half</u> of you could <u>think</u> that I <u>should</u>,<br>
  And I <u>like</u> less than <u>half</u> of you as <u>much</u> as you <u>would</u>.

  "I <u>not</u>iced a <u>lot</u>,<br>
  "Of <u>float</u>ing is <u>not</u>,<br>
  "Of <u>wood</u> which does <u>rot</u>;<br>
  "A <u>prob</u>lem I <u>thought</u>,<br>
  "'Bout <u>Mo</u>ses the <u>tot</u>.

  There.

- **Backwards Statistics Error** (**or Fallacy**, but it's my term so you won't find this on populist fallacy lists... currently... most likely... as of 2024...). This is when someone makes an argument, the truth of which is itself highly unlikely, because some aspect of the argument is rightly identifying something highly unlikely, so self-refuting overgeneralization.

  That is, in order for their argument (that a "most" argues toward an "all") to be accepted as true, once we properly understand the situation, we must admit that their argument is false (because they're evidently ignoring at least one "most").

  In this Caiaphas case, we can accept that it is indeed unlikely that Caiaphas knew the particular fisherman named John, in and of only his status as fisherman.

  But we can't accept that the disciple known to Caiaphas "can't" be John simply because John is a fisherman, even if we grant that Caiaphas could only have known him from his life prior to Jesus calling him or any such claim to near-fame, so back when he was just a random fisherman.

  Because to accept that, we must accept that Caiaphas is the rare type of person who has no connections to any non-elite.
  
  While that becomes slightly less highly unlikely for the elite-of-elites, it's still highly unlikely.

  Since these cancel out, we really just have no default either way here, and we simply look to the evidence, and see that the evidence itself makes it most likely that it's John who is known to Caiaphas.

  You could also call this **Self-refuting Overgeneralization.**

  **(Less, to None, despite a premise of Less but not therefore None.)**

  **(Or, More, to All, despite a premise of More but not therefore All.)**

  (And so forth.)

  Those "despite" premises can be implied, or logically necessary, note. A common "cheat" by promoters of such fallacious views is to simply personally avoid drawing the conclusions that would logically follow from their arguments, and hope the rest of us do too.

  We see this often for example when a less-than-reasonable evolutionist will complain about a creationist citing evolutionist sources (typically being up front that they're evolutionist, but that's not really relevant usually) to establish a premise, that they agree with or to do an internal consistency analysis.
  
  Then the less-than-reasonable objector will object that it doesn't matter because the cited source is still an evolutionist, therefore the premise must somehow not lead to the creationist's conclusion, and the objector can feel justified in ignoring the logic.

  And many similar cases.
  
  I see it a lot with those who promote various heresies like Unitarianism too.
  
  For example, the argument that since Jesus says and does only what the Father orders (which we would see as clear evidence he's the same being -- of what *different* beings can this be said? None that I know of, but they make the bad argument nonetheless), Jesus must, they claim, be a lesser entity than God, not the same Being, and not literally God.

  Yet the very same people usually admit that the Holy Spirit *is* God, although they will deny his Personhood, yet fail to do their research, evidently, to notice that the Bible also says this same thing of the Spirit (in [John 16:13-15](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/16/13)).

  When I've asked Unitarians about this point, who make the argument about Jesus, I've so far never even gotten an answer -- certainly not "I was aware of it, and such and such is why that one doesn't count" or anything like it.
  
  They just mysteriously ignore the point, or mysteriously disappear from the conversations at that point.

  To be clear, a variant on such an argument could perhaps be made logically if we find evidence that the phrasing means one thing in one case, and another in another, but that's not how the ones I see using the argument are presenting it.
  
  It's used as if simply quoting the verse about Jesus saying this of himself [John 5:19](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/5/19) proves their case with no further thought or research required.

  This is an implied likelihood argument, that you shouldn't need to think more about it to see that most likely it means Jesus is a lesser entity, a different entity, and thus not literally God (they do admit he's called God and they're correct that the term can mean authority; this is why God is named that; he's the ultimate authority, though they misuse this argument too in ways beyond the scope of this article).

  So by the same token, I must accept then that I should ignore the likelihood when it comes to the Spirit.

  I'll add too that some of their other premises require that Jesus has his own Personhood, because they say it makes him a separate being, and that "person" always equals "being," yet with the Spirit they're also denying his Personhood.

  Makes no sense.

  But since they didn't think it through before declaring the argument, this doesn't seem to matter to them. It should.

  Example of Backwards Statistics Error (or Fallacy): "It's highly likely that large wooden boats eventually break apart. We have many historical cases. They twist and turn in the waves and this puts too much stress on their hull structural integrity. This is why we make metal boats.

  "Therefore, Noah's ark could not have survived a year.

  "What? All known, well-made giant wooden boats survived much more than a year? Um... well, Noah's Ark was the one unlucky one that definitely... you know, fell apart in under a year. Cuz reasons."

  (That's a real example. I've had people make that bad argument to me personally. John Woodmorappe notes it in his landmark book *Noah's Ark: A Feasibility Study" too.)

  "Most <u>boats</u> of <u>wood</u>,<br>
  "Sink <u>fast</u>er than <u>met</u>al,<br>
  "So <u>Noah</u>'s Ark <u>would</u>,<br>
  "Sink <u>like</u> a bike <u>ped</u>al.<br>

  "How <u>long</u> is <u>long</u>?<br>
  "You <u>ask</u> if I'm <u>wrong</u>?<br>
  "Don't <u>know</u> but I'd <u>guess</u>,<br>
  "Five <u>months</u>, days, or <u>less</u>.<br>

  "What <u>did</u> you just <u>say</u>?<br>
  "It's <u>more</u> than a <u>day</u>?<br>
  "They <u>last</u> for five <u>YEARS</u>!?<br>
  "But the <u><i>Flood's</i></u> just a <u>year</u>!<br>

  "Well <u>may</u>be from <u>now</u> on,<br>
  "I'll <u>first</u> try and <u>see</u>,<br>
  "If <u>wrong</u> are Glenn <u>Mor</u>ton,<br>
  "And the <u>N</u>CS<u>E</u>."

Just to be crystal clear and thorough, Caiaphas lying about not knowing any non-elites, or specifically any fishermen, and Caiaphas using hyperbole, would both default expectations highly likely, especially hyperbole.

For the lying, this is so at least if we take the biblical data seriously about how the typical leader of the group he seems to have been part of (so not including Nicodemus for example) usually behaved, in that they don't seem concerned primarily with truth but with which words will play best politically for them.

In other words, we would expect that most likely he's a lying politician.

In any event, as far as we know, we have no such statement by Caiaphas. We need one to remove the unlikeliness that Caiaphas doesn't know any fishermen.

So we have three unlikelihoods being swept under the rug to argue based on the admittedly legitimate unlikelihood that Caiaphas knows a particular fisherman named John.

Two of them are in an opposite category based on whether we have a statement to the effect of the first.

The first is "Caiaphas doesn't know *any* fishermen."

Absent a statement, we can't know very precisely how likely this is. We only know that most likely he *does* know many non-elites, that most likely he knows some non-elites from Galilee, and that most likely some of those non-elites have a variety of jobs, some of which include fishermen.

We know from this that while the specific job of fisherman is somewhat unlikely to be among the jobs of the non-elite Galileans Caiaphas most likely knows, we certainly can't rule it out.

What use is being a Galilean if you don't relate very likely to eating, distributing, or fishing for, fish?

He at least knows people, almost certainly, who know a fisherman or a distributor of fish from Galilee, because this likely someone who Caiaphas probably knows, likely eats fish, because he or she is a Galilean.

So Caiaphas is *most likely* only *one* step removed from knowing a fisherman or fish-distributor of Galilee!

Looking a little less astronomically unlikely now that he might just know a fisherman, huh?

Now it still *is* unlikely -- let's not commit Backwards Statistics ourselves. But not at all impossible.

If we get a statement, we can ignore the above problems, but we still have the two other unlikelihoods to deal with:

First, it's unlikely he is always honest.

We would be accepting that most likely the statement is honest in this case (depending on other evidence), but only because it was already unlikely that the high priest knows a fisherman of Galilee, which we accepted from the start.

Second, that even if it's honest, it isn't essentially hyperbole.

The norm in their culture is what we would typically lump in with hyperbole.

Although for us, the connotation of hyperbole is a bit different from how they normally use as-if-universal statements.

For them the phrasing that looks absolute to us is simply their way of telling people of at least a majority.

Also for us, over-repetition might look like "he doth protest too much," but for them that was simply how they clarified they meant it literally. Which is a much more sensible and less guess-prone type of society, let's be honest.

Many moderns would react poorly to the length of this article in a similar way for example, but the only alternative they promote is then a return to wallowing in uncertainty on this topic. Why must we moderns be always stuck in uncertainty?

It would be almost fine if so many of us weren't so hand-wringey about whenever we encounter uncertainty.

We create our own problem.

What's especially weird about it is it seems to ban humans from being human -- that is, with functioning brains.

We don't seem to get upset if a crow shows evidence of intelligence, such as by using a tool.

But if a human shows signs of intelligence, those who use that objection will cry foul.

"*Most* analyses aren't thorough! They're short articles I can read in five minutes! You should write a book! Which I won't read!

"When the question is complex, we simply have no place in our culture for ever solving those puzzles! Not soundly, logically!

"Just accept my fallacies! It's easier!

"You're <u>not</u> con<u>form</u>ing to our <u>prob</u>lematic <u>cul</u>ture.<br>
"So a<u>round</u> you I <u>see</u> a lot of <u>circ</u>ling <u>vul</u>ture."

This is probably a rare reaction (let's not commit this error), but I see it often enough that it might need said.

Though I doubt most making the Lazarus argument would try it (hard to say), but I'm saying it more to be thorough on the topic of backwards statistics in general (as I might re-use this section later for a more general guide on logic).

For example, one Unitarian made a long series of arguments for Unitarianism, and I went through each argument, and debunked them line by line, since the topic is important, and there could be some people who might care about the truth and would want to know.

The first reaction (from a different Unitarian) was literally a complaint about how long the response was.

And it was very concise on each point! Yet the Unitarian who made the original argument "oddly" didn't get this objection from the same person, of course.

Then my points were summarily ignored, for the most part, with a few bad arguments thrown in.

Or, if you *don't* thoroughly debunk it, they accuse you of not understanding the topic thoroughly enough, and say you should have been more thorough.

I've literally had atheists begging, begging, begging me desperately to re-re-repeat evidence for God that had been covered in countless past conversations, and I made them promise not to complain that the response would be long, and then only one bothered to read it, they all fled, and that one just spammed with a single argument, a bad one, and fled from then.

It's a shell game.

And this topic might seem irrelevant at first, but I happened to have focused on more obviously relevant topics for a long time enough to know instantly some key ones it does touch on.

In any case, I find that most likely, following what we could call the Columbo rule, most likely the way we'll answer questions *accurately* (as we should) is by a thorough investigation, and most likely, some things that might seem trivial will most likely turn out not to be, and the only way to be sure is to check.

Now, I could at least accept that Caiaphas probably remembers clearly whether he knows of any fishermen though, such that he would personally approve them entering the gate. (He might forget having met any, but that's irrelevant.)

Although it would also be unlikely he was even personally consulted for that, since he might have been a bit busy at the time, depending on where he was when the arresting group arrived with Jesus related to where Unnamed Disciple was.

There are other fallacies that could be listed here (especially confirmation fallacy), but since I'm *not* trying to write a book, let's move on with just one more caution: that I haven't done a whole-book line by line of the entire gospel of John yet to test this.

Eventually I might, since authorship and authorial avoidance of John is an important premise to some of my reasoning.

And as said at the start, I'm not assuming I'm right, despite how strongly-worded some of my points may appear.

It could easily be that many people know some arguments I haven't been able to find, and that perhaps some of them would overturn all of this.

The goal here is more to report what I already know and to do some of the groundwork in some of the more obviously relevant areas like John 21, or John 1, or the first use of DiLoved, as an initial default answer (not assuming it).


## Fishy

Let's look at the final chapter of John now, and see why it seems fishy to argue that the Unnamed Disciple who let Peter in can't be John because John as a fisherman can't know Caiaphas.

That is that the DiLoved seems to be a fisherman.

Here, we're *granting* the backwards statistics error, for sake of argument, just to see what would happen.

After all, the fact that it's an error of likelihoods doesn't rule out that Caiaphas and all his servants might indeed not know any fishermen. We still granted that this is in fact default (unless high priests knowing fishermen of Galilee was normal, but I don't know of evidence for that).

So now we're saying that Caiaphas essentially can't know fishermen.

And we're wondering if there's evidence DiLoved is a fisherman.

Such that if one of the people called DiLoved is Lazarus, there would have to be multiple people given that "the disciple Jesus loved" appellation in the gospel of John, and it can't be the one in the final chapter, if that one is a fisherman.

And as we'll see, it then also couldn't be the one the first time the phrase is used, at the Last Supper.

On the premise of fisherman-association-free Caiaphas.

(And as shown earlier above, the DiLoved seems to be the Unnamed Disciple.)

At the end of the chapter we'll also see that DiLoved is (very strongly apparently) the author of the gospel of John.

John 21:

/1 After these things, Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias. He revealed himself this way.

2 Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus,† Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together. 3 Simon Peter said to them, “I’m going fishing.”

They told him, “We are also coming with you.” They immediately went out and entered into the boat./

Let's pause for now.

We know that three of these names are fishermen -- Peter and the sons of Zebedee. It's possible non-fishermen still could help out, so keep that in mind about the "two others." Offhand I don't know about Thomas Didymus or Nathanael of Cana, but the latter is at least of Galilee.

Before looking into them, let's just put the passages that confirm about Peter (as obvious as that seems) and the sons of Zebedee, and who they were:

Mark 1:

/16 Passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.

17 Jesus said to them, “Come after me, and I will make you into fishers for men.”

18 Immediately they left their nets, and followed him.

19 Going on a little further from there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets.

20 Immediately he called them, and they left their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him./

See also Matthew 4:18-22, very similar to Mark, and:


### A Long Luke Passage I Quoted

Luke 5:

/2 He saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets. 3 He entered into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat.

4 When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.”

5 Simon answered him, “Master, we worked all night and caught nothing; but at your word I will let down the net.”

6 When they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net was breaking.

7 They beckoned to their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them. They came and filled both boats, so that they began to sink.

8 But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord.”

9 For he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they had caught; 10 and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon.

Jesus said to Simon, “Don’t be afraid. From now on you will be catching people alive.”

11 When they had brought their boats to land, they left everything, and followed him./

I hope you read that closely. Read it one more time. Now, having returned here, read it one more time.

Got it?

Notice anything familiar? Well, you'll see when we continue in John 21.

Now, I don't know the professions of Thomas or Nathanael. I haven't studied this enough to know whether that's the current global state of knowledge though. I'll grant that Nathanael need not be a fisherman for it to be obviously plausible that he would automatically want to go fishing. It's said that he might be the Bartholomew mentioned in the synoptics, I don't know why at time of writing.

On the way to introducing Nathanael, let's cover some John 1 content.


### John 1 Clues

After the intro about the Word/Light, we're told a lot about John.

John the Baptist, that is.

The fact that John the Baptist (Bap) is simply referred to as John, often, is probably evidence for identifying the apostle John as the author of the gospel by that name for two reasons.

First that it implies the apostle John is less likely than others to feel the need to think of Bap by a more clarified name habitually. He know who he is, and while the name John is a common name, for him he would be used to simply referring to the Baptist as simply John.

I saw this at a place I worked who had two people with the same name, and two other people with a different same name. They would simply refer to each other by their own names, when referring to the other who had the same first name. The rest of us had to constantly have ways to clarify which ones we meant.

Second, people named John tend to take note of other people named John.

We see also that the gospel of John is the only one who tells us the name of the father of Peter (that's in John 21 later so we'll get there). That name is John; the apostle Peter is Peter son of John (not, presumably, John the Baptist, and not the apostle John considering that would make the apostle already very old and it's thought that he lived longer than any of the others of the 12).

It seems like the author of the gospel of John might be someone named "John."

It's just a guess.

(That was reverse hyperbole.)

Next, let's have you [scroll up and re-read the long Luke passage I had quoted](#a-long-luke-passage-i-quoted).

Then return here and keep reading.

No particular reason just yet. I just felt like it. That was reverse hyperbole.

John 1:

/14 The Word became flesh and lived among us. We saw his glory, such glory as of the only born‡ Son of the Father, full of grace and truth. 15 John testified about him. He cried out, saying, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me has surpassed me, for he was before me.’ ” 16 From his fullness we all received grace upon grace. 17 For the law was given through Moses. Grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ./

This reads as a summary of the entire book, and we're shortly going to see more context of when and where John (Bap) said this. The implication is that the "we" includes one person who saw all of this. Could that be Lazarus? I don't know, but it sure can be John son of Zebedee!

I suggest that what we're about to read is from John "Zebson's" POV.

Continuing in John 1 until otherwise noted.

/18 No one has seen God at any time. The only born† Son,‡ who is in the bosom of the Father, has declared him.

19 This is John’s testimony, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”

20 He declared, and didn’t deny, but he declared, “I am not the Christ.”

21 They asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?”

He said, “I am not.”

“Are you the prophet?”

He answered, “No.”

22 They said therefore to him, “Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”

23 He said, “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’* as Isaiah the prophet said.”

24 The ones who had been sent were from the Pharisees. 25 They asked him, “Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?”

26 John answered them, “I baptize in water, but among you stands one whom you don’t know. 27 He is the one who comes after me, who is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I’m not worthy to loosen.” 28 These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing./

This is very detailed, and while it could be passed on from other witnesses, I suggest that John Zebson was one of the disciples of John the Baptist already.

That this is in Bethany makes sense if this is Lazarus, though, but we're about to see some evidence that might favor it being someone with a brother. As far as we know, Lazarus has sisters, not brothers.

/29 The next day, he saw Jesus coming to him, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! 30 This is he of whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who is preferred before me, for he was before me.’ 31 I didn’t know him, but for this reason I came baptizing in water, that he would be revealed to Israel.”

32 John testified, saying, “I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven, and it remained on him. 33 I didn’t recognize him, but he who sent me to baptize in water said to me, ‘On whomever you will see the Spirit descending and remaining on him is he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.’ 34 I have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God.”

35 Again, the next day, John was standing with two of his disciples, 36 and he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!” 37 The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. 38 Jesus turned and saw them following, and said to them, “What are you looking for?”

They said to him, “Rabbi” (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), “where are you staying?”

39 He said to them, “Come and see.”

They came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day. It was about the tenth hour.†/

Think about who is most likely to write so many specifics about these events, even down to hour markers. An eyewitness, most likely. If it was Lazarus, this gospel doesn't shy away in at least some places from using Lazarus's name, so the goal of authorial avoidance would fail, if we're meant to read this perspective-yet-anon as Laz.

Imagine for a moment that this is John, of Galilee, and he was in Bethany, with John the Baptist.

Who is John the Baptist to Caiaphas?

Well, is he totally unknown? No, he's at the very least someone that Caiphas probably had to know about. I don't know who was high priest at this particular time, but Caiaphas still would likely know about John the Baptist. If he somehow escaped knowing who Jesus' inner circle was, it becomes even more implausible that he escaped knowing who John's inner circle was.

Lazarus very well might already be involved; like I said at the start of this absurdly long Answer main section, it isn't surprising if John and Lazarus knew each other. Jesus may have called John not entirely out of the blue, even if John didn't know Bap. And if he did, Bap is Jesus' cousin.

(Note "I didn't know him" clearly means didn't recognize above, by the way, in case you think it's denying that, as many ignorant skeptics claim. You can see Bap goes on to clarify that. And that likely means Bap didn't understand yet who precisely his cousin was, not that he didn't notice it was his cousin there that day.)

Remember we know that Jesus was praised in his childhood for advanced learning, and could be often recognized instantly as a Rabbi (teacher). I'm seeing connections here. If John Zebson is connected to Jesus long before the call, it wouldn't be surprising that Caiaphas might know (of) him.

/40 One of the two who heard John and followed him was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother. 41 He first found his own brother, Simon,/

Now, I don't know enough about Greek to know for sure that this is relevant, but why say "his own brother" rather than just "his brother"? In English, at least, in our culture, this would mean the speaker has a brother too.

Just to be sure this really says this, let's check LSB:

/[Jhn 1:40-41 LSB] 40 One of the two who heard John [speak] and followed Him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. 41 He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, "We have found the Messiah" (which translated means Christ)./

That's a yes. Again, I don't know if it's significant; maybe just saying "his own" is normal in their culture. But it suggests to me that the author might have a brother and his first tendency was to think about telling his brother, then to comment that Andrew went to inform his own brother too.

Remember this is what we expect in a pattern of authorial avoidance -- just like we saw in the trial of Jesus, clear signs of a POV, with most of the hints of who had the POV erased, to avoid seeming to claim too much personal honor. But enough there that you can understand he's telling you he was there and that's why he knows all these details, whoever he is.

Given all the evidence that the author is the apostle John, the evidence is thus placing John here. He's been placed in Bethany, then, and knowing John the Baptist, as one of his top followers already, and thus likely already placed as knowing Jesus indirectly, or at least knowing he was Bap's cousin, before Jesus even called him.

Back to WEBP:

/and said to him, “We have found the Messiah!” (which is, being interpreted, Christ‡).

42 He brought him to Jesus.

Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas” (which is by interpretation, Peter).

43 On the next day, he was determined to go out into Galilee, and he found Philip.

Jesus said to him, “Follow me.”

44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. 45 Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, “We have found him of whom Moses in the law and also the prophets, wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”/

I think this may imply that Nathanael of Cana was in the town of Bethsaida at the time. Remember we saw that the Zebsons were in the same fishing boat with Peter from Mark 1, so I think we have a group of friends here, living in the same town, or knowing each other for some reason. Or this could just be clarifying the connection to Andrew and Peter.

Thinking about who else might be in the John 21 boat, in addition to Peter, John, James, Thomas, and Nathanael, we have Andrew as a possibility, the brother of Peter -- maybe a bit odd that he isn't listed in John 21, but since it isn't Peter's gospel, not that odd -- and Philip, who is from the same city as Andrew and Peter, in Galilee.

Keep in mind the author is likely condensing a lot. We'll see evidence that Jesus is omniscient in a moment. It's possible he knew about Philip for unrelated reasons, but it's also possible he was told about friends of the Zebsons and the Johnsons (Peter and Andrew).

Now I'm going out on a bit of a limb here, but let's imagine that of the limited number of disciples Peter wanted to be with in John 21, it might have included his own brother.

If so, and the author lists Peter, but not Andrew, and lists Nathanael ahead of the priority of listing Andrew even though two other brothers are mentioned, it would by default suggest two possibilities:

First, that Andrew wrote John.

As this seems a bit unlikely, I would expect the other main possiblity I could think of:

That Nathanael is closer friends with the author of John than Andrew or Philip are. And Thomas might be as well.

If that friendship predated Jesus calling them, which is somewhat likely given that Andrew at least clearly already knew Bap, it would explain pretty much all of this, and the other two disciples most likely to be in the boat don't include Lazarus.

It seems more like Lazarus and his sisters were rich donors, connected in some way to Jesus and John the Baptist, likely, already, before Jesus' ministry.

It seems, then, that most likely, Andrew Johnson and John Zebson had a Bethany connection somehow or another, while Jesus and John Zechson (yes this is getting a bit confusing, I mean John the Baptist, son of Zechariah), had a Bethany connection somehow or another, and one of those two pairs of humans (one of them being also God) knew Lazarus likely through the other pair, whichever that was.

If it's likely that Caiaphas knew Lazarus, it's likely Caiaphas knew John if in fact John (apostle) is this other disciple of Bap.

So, if the disciple who Caiaphas knew is Lazarus, Caiaphas was only slightly less likely to know John, through Lazarus. All prior to the call to follow Jesus.

Then, it seems like Andrew was concerned for Peter, John Zebson was concerned for James Zebson, and John most likely knew Nathanael, who most likely was connected to Philip somehow or another.

Whether Jesus knew that because they begged him to include them, or simply because in his omniscience he knew that's what they would want, this makes sense.

And keep in mind, so far we're rooting this in the groundwork that John likely wrote the gospel of John.

We aren't directly attacking every instance of the use of "the disciple Jesus loved" as referring to John, but we are seeing that it looks like John has a Bethany connection, due to this strongly evidenced authorial connection, and likely explains who was in the fishing boat, and that isn't likely including Lazarus.

/46 Nathanael said to him, “Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?”

Philip said to him, “Come and see.”

47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said about him, “Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!”

48 Nathanael said to him, “How do you know me?”/

This may imply that while Nathanael might have known John Zebson, he didn't know Jesus yet. But in a bit, we'll see that he seems to know Jesus is a Rabbi already. Philip may have told him that already, though. Also "how do you know me?" might mean "how do you recognize me as what you just said?" per what John the Baptist said earlier.

/Jesus answered him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”

49 Nathanael answered him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are King of Israel!”

50 Jesus answered him, “Because I told you, ‘I saw you underneath the fig tree,’ do you believe? You will see greater things than these!” 51 He said to him, “Most certainly, I tell you all, hereafter you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”/


### Nathanael = Bartholomew?

Now since scholars think Bartholomew = Nathanael, let's see how at least the basic evidence lines up.

Matthew 9:

/35 Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people. 36 But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them because they were harassed and scattered, like sheep without a shepherd.

37 Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest indeed is plentiful, but the laborers are few. 38  Pray therefore that the Lord of the harvest will send out laborers into his harvest.”/

10:

/1 He called to himself his twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every sickness.

2 Now the names of the twelve apostles are these. The first, Simon, who is called Peter; Andrew, his brother; James the son of Zebedee; John, his brother; 3 Philip; Bartholomew; Thomas; Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus; Lebbaeus, who was also called† Thaddaeus; 4 Simon the Zealot; and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.

5 Jesus sent these twelve out and commanded them, saying, “Don’t go among the Gentiles, and don’t enter into any city of the Samaritans. 6  Rather, go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 7  As you go, preach, saying, ‘The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!’/

His instructions continue, but the key is that if you divide the group of twelve, in the order listed here, into groups of two, you see that Philip gets listed with Bartholomew. Here that is again, with paragraph breaks added this way:

2 Now the names of the twelve apostles are these. The first, Simon, who is called Peter; Andrew, his brother;

James the son of Zebedee; John, his brother;

3 Philip; Bartholomew;

Thomas; Matthew the tax collector;

James the son of Alphaeus; Lebbaeus, who was also called† Thaddaeus;

4 Simon the Zealot; and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him./

Relevant because although nothing in the instructions or narration in Matthew (so I've been told) says that they were sent out in pairs (although Jesus does make an analogy of two birds, which might imply it, in 10:29, but I don't see anything else, at least not in close proximity).

We get that it was pairs from the parallel passage in:

Mark 6:

/7 He called to himself the twelve, and began to send them out two by two; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits./

This appears to imply that Bartholomew = Nathanael, since Philip called Nathanael according to John, and is listed with Bartholomew.

This would add evidence that one of the two others in the boat in John 21 was probably Philip.

Of course it's no surprise that Andrew is listed with his brother Peter, and James with his brother John, but of course, it then becomes all the more surprising if Andrew isn't one of the two in the John 21 boat.

(In the parallel in Luke 9:1-6 for this particular sending, neither the pairings nor the listing are included.)

It seems that that sendout was later than the following, since in both Mark and Luke, the following is listed first, although we have extrabiblical attestation that Mark didn't necessarily write in chronological order, which could be true of all four gospels as far as I know in some cases. I'm listing these in the order of results of "Bartholomew" and since the name isn't used earlier in Matthew, the other sendout came up first since Matthew is listed first.

I would need to study more / review more and I have so many tabs open trying to be thorough by Columbo rules right now I can't open more at the moment; my computer isn't handling it well, but it looks like Matthew may be condensing two incidents, while Mark and Luke tell the calling first, and then the later sendout. LSB, or at least BLB for LSB, puts Matthew 10, which we already saw, listed as parallel to Mark 3 and Luke 6, the ones I'll show below, yet for Matthew 10, it lists Mark 6 and Luke 9 as the parallel.

Mark 3:

/13 He went up into the mountain and called to himself those whom he wanted, and they went to him. 14 He appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them out to preach 15 and to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons: 16 Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter); 17 James the son of Zebedee; and John, the brother of James, (whom he called Boanerges, which means, Sons of Thunder); 18 Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot; 19 and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him./

There's no mention of sendout instructions so I think Mark is either just saying that Jesus already had told them this would eventually be part of the reason for calling twelve, or is explaining that Peter later understood that and told him so, or else is simply deducing that Jesus had that intention all along. (Or Jesus might have told them that later, but it would be natural to presume it.)

In any case, so far we still have no Nathanael, but we do have Philip listed next to Bartholomew, and the others are all accounted for. If we put them in pairs, we see that it's the same order from Matthew 10, except Andrew is moved later in the list. To indicate that, I'll presume that John and James should be counted together, and that Peter is listed a little ahead because the top three who are often listed together in other incidents, Peter, James, and John, lead the list, and then Andrew got stuck in the list later. So I won't put Peter or Andrew in pairs. Let's see if it works.

/16 Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter);

17 James the son of Zebedee; and John, the brother of James, (whom he called Boanerges, which means, Sons of Thunder);

18 Andrew;

Philip; Bartholomew;

Matthew; Thomas;

James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus;

Simon the Zealot; 19 and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him./

Compare again with the list from Matthew 10:

/2b The first, Simon, who is called Peter; Andrew, his brother;

James the son of Zebedee; John, his brother;

3 Philip; Bartholomew;

Thomas; Matthew the tax collector;

James the son of Alphaeus; Lebbaeus, who was also called† Thaddaeus;

4 Simon the Zealot; and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him./

If you start from the end of the lists, the pairings are the same, until we get to Andrew -- and Philip and Bartholomew are listed together again. Thomas and Matthew's order within the pairing is flipped, and same with James and John, but other pairings aren't flipped.

This makes it look like both are related to the pairing in the sendout in Matthew 10, with the Matthew 10 list being the actual pairs sent, and Mark's list being just a general order of the disciples that preserves some of that, but it makes sense he isn't necessarily implying the pairings here intentionally, he's just preserving a memory from Peter that these were often paired together, after first preserving the memory of the top three.

So once again, Philip looks like a likely candidate to be in the John 21 boat.

You could argue that it "demotes" Andrew a bit, but he's the fourth one listed, right after the top three, so I don't think that flies.

Alternatively, it could mean the pairings represent closest friendships, in which case John would be closer to Andrew per Mark 3, and again, Andrew looks likely to be in the John 21 boat, since we know both sons of Zebedee were.

Now we have Luke 6, parallel about the naming of the twelve as apostles:

/13 When it was day, he called his disciples, and from them he chose twelve, whom he also named apostles:

14 Simon, whom he also named Peter; Andrew, his brother; James; John; Philip; Bartholomew; 15 Matthew; Thomas; James the son of Alphaeus; Simon who was called the Zealot; 16 Judas the son of James; and Judas Iscariot, who also became a traitor./

Let's list them in pairs again:

/14 Simon, whom he also named Peter; Andrew, his brother;

James; John;

Philip; Bartholomew;

15 Matthew; Thomas;

James the son of Alphaeus; Simon who was called the Zealot;

16 Judas the son of James; and Judas Iscariot, who also became a traitor./

Thaddeus / Lebbaeus is missing, but the other names all match, which seems to mean that "Judas the son of James" is Thaddeus / Lebbaeus. If they have two James (Jameses? Jameseses? Two people named James) already, and a Judas, it makes sense they might try multiple nicknames for Judas the son of James, to avoid confusion.

This Judas Jameson is swapped with Simon, now listed with James Alphson, rather than with Judas Istraitorot.

Now we were testing the idea that perhaps it's just closer to some other reason like coincidence that Jesus chose Philip to send with Bartholomew who seems to be Nathanael, and if we would have found them not listed together here, we would have said it's to be admitted as evidence that they might not be that close, thus, perhaps, Bartholomew might not be Nathanael after all, or if he is, Philip might not be in John 21.

But if we take that premise, and apply it to the end of the list, it also implies that James Alphson, Simon Zealotry, Judas Jameson, and Judas Iscariot are not all that close, or, are about as close between the four of them.

This would in turn just back up all the more that Philip is probably a close friend of Nathanael's.

Also since the brother pairings are included again, it implies the pairings are intentional, and may be about how they knew each other, in some cases, before Jesus called them.

This leaves one other list that includes Bartholomew:

Acts 1:

/13 When they had come in, they went up into the upper room where they were staying, that is Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James./

Now our pattern with Philip is broken, but interestingly not in a way that hurts our theory of who was in John 21.

If we presume that John and James should be listed together again, the pairings look like this now:

/13 When they had come in, they went up into the upper room where they were staying, that is Peter,

John, James,

Andrew,

Philip, Thomas,

Bartholomew, Matthew,

James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot,

and Judas the son of James./

Simon is still in the pairing with James Alphson by this pairing, the move we saw in Luke, and the 2-Judas group is left with only one Judas. The start of the list looks the same as Mark's disciples-called list, except the order of listing of the sons of Zebedee has flipped again, and the four in the middle are still listed close, even though Philip is now listed with Thomas, and Matthew with Bartholomew.

But in so doing, we have promoted Thomas (so to speak), and helped explain why Thomas might be in the John 21 boat, which we were told in that chapter of that book. So if we go down this list, and simply count the same number of people from John 21, we have the same people I theorized were in that boat; we have Peter, we have the sons of Zebedee, we have a Thomas, we have someone who by process of elimination seems to be Nathanael (Bartholomew), and listed *ahead* of the apparent Nathanael, we have Andrew and Philip!

Now, this can be a coincidence. Remember the Fallacy of Extrapolation mentioned earlier. We have limited data here, so we can't read too much out from these lists. But it does at least provide some additional evidence, combined with all the rest already shown, that Philip is *relatively* close to Nathanael -- and by the way, now to Thomas as well, who matches a confirmed name in that boat -- and that Matthew and below in the list are perhaps less likely to be in that boat.

Basically, it *looks* like we have "The fishermen or close friends of those fishermen... then the tax collector... then other dudes."

That seems to be consistent throughout all of these lists, and fits naturally with the other evidence we looked at.

And once again, Andrew is still ahead of the list of Thomas, and anybody else who might be Nathanael.

Now, maybe Nathanael isn't Bartholomew at all. Maybe he's one of the two considered to replace Judas Isdeadiot, or some other disciple beyond the 12.

Those other two are:

Acts 1:

/23 They put forward two: Joseph called Barsabbas, who was also called Justus, and Matthias. 24 They prayed and said, “You, Lord, who know the hearts of all men, show which one of these two you have chosen 25 to take part in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell away, that he might go to his own place.” 26 They drew lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was counted with the eleven apostles./

Maybe Matthias has nicknames, although it would be a bit weird if his nickname of Nathanael, if it exists, isn't listed here, since this Joseph gets two nicknames (they like nicknames... or translations or whatever this is).


#### Rabbit: Names

Let's look at the name meanings per BLB. Be aware, this is going to be quite a diversion. If you want, click this link to skip to the conclusion: [Skip Rabbit: Names](#skip-rabbit-names)

- Joseph, Greek Ἰωσήφ, in Lingua (Ln) Ee'oh'SEYF / Iy'ohSEYF / Ioseyf (single apostrophe in Lingua is a silent sound-separator, in this case of Ee'oh'SEYF also happening to go where dash as optional syllable separator could go; Ee-oh-SEYF, with the halfway-capitalization of Ee indicating perhaps a middle emphasis, all-caps SEYF being the syllable BLB marks as emphasized, Ioseyf would be a version for capitalizing it like a normal English name)) = <b>\|"let him add"\|</b>; Hebrew יוֹסֵף Ln yohSEYF / Yoseyf = \|"Jehovah has added"\|

  That's Yeho+seph, with e and o being the vowel replacements from the short version of YHWH, Yahweh ("w" spelled originally as "u", so Yah"u"eh, or Yahu for short). With seph meaning add.

  For a name version translated into English, which is something I try to do, to get a better sense of how names seemed to the ancients (they didn't think of names as only vaguely having a meaning in some other language like we usually do in English; they usually wanted their name to mean something clear in their own language, so a real translation of the Bible should do this), I often translate Yah/Yahu as Lord, since that's how many translations refer to YHWH, and Jews used Adonai or the vowels from it to get Yehovah, and Eli/El as God.

  Despite BLB putting "has added" in quotes, the Strong's they give says it's future tense like the quoted summary BLB gave for the Greek. Translating names to English with tense for future wouldn't look good, and past sense might be a bit weird here (Lordadded...), so we could say Lordadd, or to avoid the "dad" sound, <u>Lordsum</u>, or something like that.

    It's from when Rachel named Joseph son of Jacob son of Isaac son of Abraham (not Joseph son of Jacob of the end of the genealogy in Matthew 1; that Joseph is Mary's husband), saying /Gen 30:24 - And she named him Joseph, saying, “May Yahweh [fn]give me another son.”/ but the footnote says \|Lit add to me; Heb Joseph\|. It's really Hebrew Yosehf. (In spelling. I'm not very clear on whether the Greek version of E that looks like a lowercase n is the one pronounced eh or the one pronounced ey; I just went with ey above since BLB said so.)

- Barsabbas, Greek Βαρσαβᾶς Ln Bahr'sah'BAHS, which BLB helpfully translates \|"son of Sabas"\|. And says: \|Of Aramaic origin בַּר (H1247) and probably צְבָה (H6634)\| That's bahr (well-known as the Aramaic equivalent of behn / ben, meaning son or son of), and Ln ts^b-AH.

  In Lingua, I don't have a great way to turn schwa (^, unstressed uh) into a normal letter, other than to just leave it out and keep a silent apostrophe separator, so we would get, for a more normal spelling and capitalization (not indicating syllable stress anymore): Ts'bah.

  BLB translates: \|to desire, be inclined, be willing, be pleased\| Strong's also mentions will, and we're told it corresponds to another word spelled almost identically: צְבָא. The only difference in pronunciation is they put the B with the final syllable, which I thought it was weird they didn't for the earlier one (hence I included the dash to clarify), so this would be ts^-BAH. The only spelling difference is that the final letter is the aleph vowel carrier (Hebrew's consonantal equivalent of the first letter of the alphabet although it isn't a vowel, but similar to our letter A or Greek's alpha, from which we get "alphabet") instead of the final silent H of the other one.

  We're told this one means to fight, war, serve, assemble, muster, wait upon, etc.

  I suggest using a play on the common English name of "Will." But could also be War or something like that. For "Son of" I usually flip the order, removing any prepositions, turning the object of the preposition into an adjective. If you didn't, you would get Sonwill or Sonwar, which might be better because you then understand the order of what means what, but hopefully everybody knows Bar and Ben mean son, so Benjamin Son of Right Hand becomes Rightson instead of the awkward Sonright, so we would get Wilson. It's all about Wilson. Or, Warson. Or <u>Willson</u> if you must be picky.

  Moving on... Anyways, those two names don't sound similar, but if Ts'bah was his father's name, we wouldn't expect it, but maybe it means willful, something like Sons of Thunder. Doesn't seem to be a translation of Joseph. BLB does say he was "surnamed" Barsabas/Barsabbas.

- Justus means Just. I'm shocked. Greek (Gk) Ἰοῦστος Ln eeUEStohs / Iu'stos. (What we might spell "Ioostohs" in normal English; ue is as in true, not "uh". We might also spell it Eustace. Well, scrub that, Eustos.) For a translation, to avoid confusion with the "mere" sense of "just," I suggest <u>Justice</u>. BLB oddly lists it also as a surname. Not sure if that word means something to them that I don't think it means.

- Matthias looks to mean essentially the same as Matthew. This is going to get complicated, but both seem to mean gift of God/Lord.

  For Matthias, they say \|"gift of God"\| for the Greek form as it is in Acts here: Μαθθίας Ln mahTHIYahs / Ma'thiahs, and \|Apparently a shortened form of Ματταθίας (G3161)\| (Mattithiah), yet for that word they say \|"gift of Jehovah"\|. The -s suffix is, I think, just a common thing with Greek names, so I think this is really from Yah, which I see on the end of this: \|Of Hebrew origin מַתַּתְיָה (H4993)\| which I'll show the full details of later below. But that would be Lord in my system, not God.

  God in Greek would be theos, which it just happens to look like thias in Matthias, but this seems to be a coincidence, since the Hebrew really did have a "t" of the type often spelled TH, sometimes argued to be pronounced T + H (not our English "th" sound as in "thin" but like "tin" with a blowing breath sound as you release the T, what in Ln full would be T'hin, not to be confused with t'-hin with t' as a separate syllable implying schwa -- but I've seen arguments that in ancient Hebrew, unlike modern Hebrew, it really was pronounced like English th as in thin, so I just spell my Lingua transliterations that way for Hebrew th).

  It seems like BLB flubbed here, or they don't care so much about translating YHWH as "Lord" consistently (what here they call "Jehovah"). And Lord isn't translated; it's normally turned into kurios in Greek (the standard transliteration from memory), so this Matthias looks indeed to be shortened raw transliteration of Hebrew (Hb) Mattithiah מַתַּתְיָה Ln Mah-tihth-^YAH / Mahtihth'YAH / Matihth'YAH / Matihth'yah.

  Here for translating the name, in my system, we run into a problem, where I don't like to end names in ways that you might confuse for a name for God. A raw translation would be Giftlord (or if BLB were right for the Gk, Giftgod). In my name translation system it's better to flip the order of the parts than to avoid such confusions (we're not calling this human a God of gifts; in English Giftgod or Giftlord looks like Gift as adjectival noun of noun God/Lord, which would mean it could be flipped to the object of the preposition of).

  So I would end up with Godgift, or Lordgift more accurately, or to avoid the unfortunate connotation of "God's gift to humanity" a bit, let's go with <u>Lordgiven</u>. (Godgiven also is a bit too similar to "our God-given rights". And since it seems inaccurate...)

- Nathanael Gk Ναθαναήλ Ln nahth-Ahn-ah-EYL / nahthAhna'EYL / nathAhna'EYL / Nathana'eyl. \|"gift of God"\|. Well didn't see that coming! It actually does fit well with Matthias. Makes sense; they're similar-souding. This is actually a transliteration of "el" from Elohim, God, so here "gift of God" is accurate, or what in my translation system we would be reluctantly forced to call Godgiven or Godgift. Hm, I wonder if a theory that this is Matthias is why BLB translated it this way.

  I know they translate names... does Hebrew do multiple spellings with the same meaning while still in Hebrew? That's what it now seems like this would be...

  It's still most likely based on the mention of his calling early in John that Nathanael has to be a member of the twelve, but this does look like slight evidence against my theory, and for Nathanael as Matthias.

  Which means members of the 12 wouldn't be the only candidates to be in that boat (not that we were ever going to prove that anyways, but in terms of what we have evidence for, now I have at least slight evidence for someone beyond the 12, which definitely opens the door for Lazarus, assuming Lazarus would ever go fishing).

  And it wouldn't be all that surprising that John might list the calling of one of the two guys who were considered to replace Judas I-steal-a-lot, nor would it be surprising that they might want to go fishing with people other than members of the 12.

  They say \|Of Hebrew origin נְתַנְאֵל (H5417)\|, Ln N^th-ah-n^-EHL / N'thahnEHL / N'thanel, and that is \|"given of God"\| (Well there you go; for the Lordgift, I was justified in using Lordgiven... Anywho.) So that would be Godgiven indeed.

  Minus el, it's a variant, obviously, of a word that could be transliterated the same as Nathan (although BLB doesn't list it as such... well, not in the main two sections. The third section goes on and on and on, and even I would probably never have enough patience to follow up on all the links there, wow... and fourth...? I dunno. Kind of long, and they don't transliterate. I'm getting too tired of this rabbit hole, and that doesn't really seem relevant, I was just wondering.)

  Hb נָתַן Ln nahTHAHN / na'THAHN / naTHAN / Nathan. (Well, yeah, it does work out to the same transliteration in Lingua too as the normal name Nathan but don't confuse that with the NAYth^n pronunciation.) Meaning, to give, put, set.

  I don't see any mention here of it being related to Matthew. I really should go look that one up, but this diversion has been so long... I'm willing to just accept that "given" and "given" are potentially similar, but all the other evidence I found seems to better fit that Nathanael is Bartholomew. Let's move on to that one.

- Bartholomew. Gk Βαρθολομαῖος Ln... well, so many syllables I won't put even guesses on the "partial stress" for the first try... bahr-thohl-ohm-AH-ee-ohs. BLB says yohs for the end there and let's go with it. I'm not sure if the "bar" part, the son of part, should have syllable stress or not, but tentatively let's just go with the alternating rhythm default I use. So, bahr-Thohl-ohm-AH-yohs / bar'Thohl'ohmAHyos. And since AH followed by y can just be the "eye" sound (Ln ai), bar'Thohl'ohmAIos / Bar'thohl'ohmaios.

  To reduce apostrophes, Bar'thowlohmaios. (I have to avoid "hlo" since it would imply the H is pronounced, but the H was only there to clarify the O is oh rather than ah.)

  Technically, Lingua itself only allows "o" by itself to be a shortening of "oh," and "a" by itself can only be shortening of "ah" so as long as you know Lingua's rules, we can get it down to Bartholomaios which is actually identical to one field BLB offers calls their "Transliteration." So they and Lingua agree for once. I just normally avoid shortenings that will be mispronounced by English speakers if that's all they see.

  Anywho, it means \|"son of Tolmai"\|, and unsurprisingly since "bar" is "son of" in Aramaic, \|Of Aramaic origin בַּר (H1247) and תַּלְמַי (H8526)\|. That last is Ln Tohl^MAHy, \|"furrowed"\| or \|ridged\|. A "proper name". This isn't that relevant probably, most likely it just means Bartholomew is the son of a guy named Tolmai.

  I find that that's still good evidence that Bartholomew isn't his "first" name as we in modern English society would call it, which supports that he is really Nathanael Bartholomew. Perhaps the similarity to Matthias or Matthew might be why he was typically known by his "last name" instead, while not actually being Matthias (or Matthew for that matter, most likely), to differentiate. I feel like that's a reasonable guess, although I might just be biased for my theory here.


#### Skip Rabbit: Names

Conclusion:

Surprisingly, Nathanael does mean essentially the same thing as Matthias, from Acts 2, so it's possible it's a synonym or something??? So Nathanael might not be Bartholomew after all.

(Acts 1 makes it clear Bartholomew is a member of the 12 already, and Matthias is being considered to replace Judas I-scare-a-lot there, so Bartholomew and Matthias can't be the same guy, although this doesn't disprove my theory, shared by most scholars allegedly, that Bartholomew = Nathanael.)

Nathanael could also quite possibly not be a member of the Twelve or Matthias. Either this or the Matthias theory would help support that Lazarus might be more likely to be one of the two unnamed John 21 disciples.

But I think it's by far better-evidenced that they're most likely Andrew and Philip.

Enough of this!


### Sons of Zebedee? Who Are They?
Another point in favor of authorial avoidance is that aside from the apostle John being conspicuously never mentioned by name in the entire gospel of John, the list of names on this boat shies away from specifics first with "sons of Zebedee" in John 21.

If John is all you read, you would have no idea who they are. This is clearly meant to trust that the reader has read at least one of the other gospels already (remember John is believed to have been written last, although that might be somewhat premised on John actually being the author).

That this is finally seen, in the last chapter (not that there were chapters, but the chapter division in this case clearly is actually accurate to this being the last section), I think is John's equivalent of the Mark hint that Mark is that young man who fled anonymously in Mark.

Of course, you could argue that the other two disciples in the boat are even more anonymous, but I mean that proximity to the end actually makes that a bit less likely to be the author (either of the two unnamed ones in this case).

Also since there's two and we aren't told the name of the other one either, I doubt that anonymity is meant as anything other than just not overwhelming the reader with irrelevant side details, and just necessary if it's John and the sons of Zebedee reference means what I think it means; he would need to give the reader "plausible deniability" that the author might be one of these two unnamed disciples.

But that in turn means that all the more I'm most likely right that these two wouldn't surprise us if we were told who they are -- again fitting Andrew and Philip best.

That last point does require the premise that the author is John (or James), but I mean that it's internally consistent, so wouldn't be an argument *against* the author being John.


### Therefore God

Now we're finally ready to continue in John 21 where we left off, which was with poor verse 4 unfinished:

/That night, they caught nothing. 4 But when day had already come, Jesus stood on the beach; yet the disciples didn’t know that it was Jesus. 5 Jesus therefore said to them, “Children, have you anything to eat?”

They answered him, “No.”

6 He said to them, “Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.”
They cast it therefore, and now they weren’t able to draw it in for the multitude of fish.

7 That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It’s the Lord!”/

Okay, did you read that? Read it again. Now let's re-show the Luke passage I kept emphasizing:

Luke 5:

/2 He saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets. 3 He entered into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat.

4 When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.”

5 Simon answered him, “Master, we worked all night and caught nothing; but at your word I will let down the net.”

6 When they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net was breaking.

7 They beckoned to their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them. They came and filled both boats, so that they began to sink.

8 But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord.”

9 For he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they had caught; 10 and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon.

Jesus said to Simon, “Don’t be afraid. From now on you will be catching people alive.”

11 When they had brought their boats to land, they left everything, and followed him./

Jesus is re-enacting this, in John 21. And notice that the DiLoved "therefore" said it's Jesus. Not that he looked closer and saw it was him, but because of the re-enactment of something *he was present for.*

So... read the Luke passage *again.* We know the sons of Zebedee were there!

/So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he wrapped his coat around himself (for he was naked), and threw himself into the sea. 8 But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits‡ away), dragging the net full of fish./

Two hundred cubits is, as the footnote says: \|Approx. 100 yd. or 91 m, a cubit was approx. 18 in. or 45 cm\|.

That confirms it's too far for them to have recognized Jesus. At least his face; perhaps if he still had familiar clothes. But I think it's pretty clear that the DiLoved is John connecting the dots to what Jesus did in the Luke passage.

/9 So when they got out on the land, they saw a fire of coals there, with fish and bread laid on it. 10 Jesus said to them, “Bring some of the fish which you have just caught.”

11 Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land, full of one hundred fifty-three great fish. Even though there were so many, the net wasn’t torn.

12 Jesus said to them, “Come and eat breakfast!”

None of the disciples dared inquire of him, “Who are you?” knowing that it was the Lord.

13 Then Jesus came and took the bread, gave it to them, and the fish likewise. 14 This is now the third time that Jesus was revealed to his disciples after he had risen from the dead.

15 So when they had eaten their breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me more than these?”/

WEBP is saying Simon son of "Jonah." LSB has "son of John." The name Jonah (in Jonah 1:1) is this in the Greek LXX (Gk): Ἰωνάμ transliteration Ionam, Lingua (Ln) Ee-oh-NAHM, Hebrew (Hb) יוֹנָה transliteration Yonah, Lingua yoh-NAH, said to mean \|"Jehovah is a gracious giver"\|, and the Greek in this verse is:

Gk Ἰωάννου transliteration Ioannou, Ln Ee-oh-AHN-neys, said to mean \|"Jehovah has graced"\|, of \|A form of יְהוֹחָנָן (H3076)\| Hb transliteration Yehokhanan, Ln y^-Hoh-khah-NAHN, said to mean same as the Gk form.

In the Hebrew, these seem almost the same with "Yo" being a normal shortening of "Yeho," part of the altered Yahweh (altered Yahu), although I don't know the relationship of "nah" with "khanan," beyond that BLB is saying that "grace" is the meaning (basically) of both.

So, okay, John could be "Jonah" here. Is it the same as in the case of Bap?

Gk Ἰωάννης Ioannes

This is the same root that BLB said that Pete's dad is (I didn't show it above, but it is; I checked). This is nominative singular masculine, the other was genitive singular masculine.

So, it seems to me it's the same name. Weird that WEBP calls it Jonah. I think LSB makes more sense. They might technically mean the same thing, but why obscure that the book of John has yet another person named John in it?

In any case, it does.

Again to me that means that people named John stand out to this author (named John).

I checked, and no other gospel reveals that the name of Peter's father is John (assuming it would be spelled as the same word in Greek; I only did a BLB word search for it after confirming it in John 21 is the same word as in John 1).

There were some interesting finds in Acts.

In Acts 4, after (in 3) Peter and John were preaching, they're arrested and we're told in 4:5-6 that rulers/elders/scribes were gathered, and Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, and John and Alexander, /and all who were of high-priestly descent./ (LSB)

Really doesn't matter, but it's interesting that evidently someone of high-priestly descent (I think that last phrase is meant to modify all four of these names) is listed right after Caiaphas, and we know of two people named John tied to Galilee, and there's also John the Baptist and yeah. Potentially two people named John were known to Caiphas. It's totally irrelevant probably, but hey.

Then there was this which I had no idea of:

/[Act 12:11-12 LSB] 11 When Peter came to himself, he said, "Now truly I know that the Lord has sent His angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting." 12 And when he realized [this], he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John who was also called Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying./

Probably this is a coincidence that the mother of someone I think we present at Jesus' arrest (Mark) happens to be named Mary (we do know John and Mary are common names, obviously), but based just on this snippet, it could be that the one told to take care of her at the cross is Mark. But... probably just a different Mary? Not sure if anything in the context makes it clear either way.

But it made me wonder if in fact, DiLoved is Mark... I hope I'm joking? But yeah. Doesn't fit all of the evidence that it has to be the author of John, who apparently has to be John (son of Zebedee... not John called Mark). But that was a surprise.

Back to John 21:

/He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you.”

He said to him, “Feed my lambs.” 16 He said to him again a second time, “Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me?”

He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you.”

He said to him, “Tend my sheep.” 17 He said to him the third time, “Simon, son of Jonah, do you have affection for me?”

Peter was grieved because he asked him the third time, “Do you have affection for me?” He said to him, “Lord, you know everything. You know that I have affection for you.”

Jesus said to him, “Feed my sheep. 18  Most certainly I tell you, when you were young, you dressed yourself and walked where you wanted to. But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you don’t want to go.”

19 Now he said this, signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. When he had said this, he said to him, “Follow me.”

20 Then Peter, turning around, saw a disciple following. This was the disciple whom Jesus loved, the one who had also leaned on Jesus’ chest at the supper and asked, “Lord, who is going to betray you?”/

This is where we have our confirmation that Last Supper DiLoved = John 21 Boat DiLoved.

/21 Peter, seeing him, said to Jesus, “Lord, what about this man?”

22 Jesus said to him, “If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to you? You follow me.”

23 This saying therefore went out among the brothers§ that this disciple wouldn’t die. Yet Jesus didn’t say to him that he wouldn’t die, but, “If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to you?”/

Since it's thought that John actually lived quite a long time, this would make sense. He probably was writing this later in life. We know it's thought to be (translation: we don't know) later than the other gospels. Etc. So it seems like this is another hint that it's John.

That said, it would make sense here as Lazarus too, since associating Lazarus with not dying obviously fits, but we're about to get our strong evidence that it can't be (if extrabiblical attestation is right that it's John, and all this other evidence that points to a guy named John who is very central among, probably, the 12).

/24 This is the disciple who testifies about these things, and wrote these things. We know that his witness is true. 25 There are also many other things which Jesus did, which if they would all be written, I suppose that even the world itself wouldn’t have room for the books that would be written./

More about the "we know" part in a bit. But notice the first-person in "I suppose" and the phrasing of the first sentence (here) in verse 24.


## Who Wrote John?

Hint: John.

Let's go through the attestation and other arguments in JPH's article on this. For the full details, go to his site (see abbreviations section in endnotes) and his by-Bible-book section of the hub page, to John, and it's the first link (the one in the intro paragraph at the top). I won't link it here in case the link changes in the future.

First, Irenaeus, said to be a student of Polycarp, who is in turn said to be a student of John, quoted Polycarp:

\|John, the disciple of the Lord, who leaned back on his breast, published the Gospel while he was resident at Ephesus in Asia...\|

I won't be showing all the arguments against this or the responses JPH gives here. Read his article for that. It suffices to say, it wasn't Lazarus, even if I were to grant all the objections there (which weren't about arguing for Lazarus, but about which John).

\|John's Gospel is in good Greek with some semitizing\|

This is a quote of an opponent, who then goes on to whine about it for reasons unrelated here, but this is relevant to why it could be that John was more educated than Peter, if he wrote on his own, though his statement that he "wrote" these things could possibly be embedding of an unnamed amanuensis (scribe, someone who would take dictation from another to write down their words, or translations of them, or paraphrases of them).

What we do know is that 1st Peter is said to be written through a scribe, Silas/Silvanus:

1st Peter 5:

/12 Through Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I consider him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand./

We also have this in 2nd Peter 3:

/1 This is now, beloved, the second letter that I have written to you; and in both of them I stir up your sincere mind by reminding you.../

If you read this by itself, you might think Peter personally literally wrote (rather than dictated) both letters, but we know that this is how he's defining dictation from the previous passage in the first letter, and note the wording there also said "I have written to you" -- "through" the scribe. So that again is most likely what he means here in 2nd Peter too. (Note this is another example of embedding language.)

So this establishes that most likely, Peter, a fisherman, wasn't as capable for personally writing something himself (whether due to illiteracy, or choosing to send the letter in Greek while he might only know how to write in Hebrew, or feeling that his command of the language was not as good as the scribe, etc.).

This could also apply just as easily to John. But it's also possible evidence that John was more learned than most fishermen, so in turn, possible evidence for higher likelihood of John specifically knowing an elite like Caiaphas.

Also, that Peter relied on Mark to write down his teachings evidences this, or at least a possible lesser knowledge of Greek specifically (he may have told them what to write in Aramaic, or Hebrew, although it’s likely everyone knew some Greek). This is reported by Eusebius, a historian, quoting the earlier Papias:

\|Mark indeed, since he was the interpreter of Peter, wrote accurately, but not in order, the things either said or done by the Lord as much as he remembered. For he neither heard the Lord nor followed Him, but afterwards, as I have said, [heard and followed] Peter, who fitted his discourses to the needs [of his hearers] but not as if making a narrative of the Lord's sayings'; consequently, Mark, writing down some things just as he remembered, erred in nothing; for he was careful of one thing - not to omit anything of the things he heard or to falsify anything in them.\|

I mentioned that I think the anonymous young man in Mark at the arrest of Jesus is Mark. The line here about "neither heard the Lord nor followed him" could be taken as denying this is possible, but since the arrest is obviously at the end of the ministry, that doesn't make sense to me. It's fully plausible that it means Mark wasn't present for most of Jesus' ministry, converting only near the end. Given that Mark has some kind of close relationship to Peter as probably top student, he likely had to start fairly early. See:

1st Peter 5:

/13 She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, greets you. So does Mark, my son./

It's thought this doesn't mean that John Mark was literally Peter's son, though that would certainly explain all of the above, but rather a poetic description of his close relationship as Peter's top student.

It might also be that Mark "writing down" means Mark translated Hebrew or Aramaic to Greek, and Silvanus did the literal writing, I don't know. (To help explain why Mark isn't said to be the one 1st Peter was written through.) And the vague mention of "She who is in Babylon" might refer to Peter's wife. This could also imply Mark might literally be their son. If so, the Mary seen earlier would be Peter's wife, but again, this doesn't seem to be the standard view, perhaps for good reasons I'm unaware of. I especially haven't focused as much on Acts as many have and am not a scholar, so that wouldn't surprise me.

In any case, the point is that Peter is attested in Scripture to have relied on this Silvanus/Silas, and attested extrabiblically (but with strong evidence in Scripture) to have relied on Mark to some capacity.

If these clues mean what they seem to mean, and if John really did write directly rather than using scribes, it may evidence a better-than-usual education, perhaps because his father may have been a somewhat wealthier fisherman than others, and his theology is very advanced, making it plausible that he’s the one who was known to the high priest.

That said, the line /we know that his witness is true/ (John 21:24) is taken by some to indicate the use of scribes, or that John’s students wrote the final form of the gospel. I think more likely it’s including the author’s first-person affirmation that he knows what he says is true, and that of other witnesses whose presence has been mentioned, given that the very same verse confirms /This is the disciple who is bearing witness to these things and wrote these things/ and the next /I suppose/ (showing first-person writing).

Also, in their culture, no writing was likely a solitary project; it’s thought that it was normal for the author to be collaborating in discussing ideas of what to write next with others. So any statement I make about who apparently wrote a work needs to be understood in light of this caveat, that the specific word choice might not be solely his own even if he was the one physically writing. Also dictation to a scribe was normal even for the highly educated, as Paul himself says many times that he did.

Still, it does seem that the author of John was somewhat closer to the physical writing and closer to being the sole intellectual source for the wordings than Peter.

If we only had the gospel named after John, this might indeed seem like an argument for Lazarus, but in comparing it to the three Johannine epistles and the book of Revelation, all four also thought to be authored by John, it’s very similar, as I'l cover in more detail later.

Another source for Markan authorship of Mark is Clement of Alexandria, evidently quoted here by Eusebius (this is only mentioned by JPH, quoting here from a google result, I duplicated their italics which seems to be what they think is the quote, or perhaps paraphrase, of Clement, and bold for Mark and Clement, though not Papias):

\|And thus when the divine word had made its home among them [the Christians in Rome], the power of Simon [the magician] was quenched and immediately destroyed, together with the man himself.

And so greatly did the splendor of piety illumine the minds of PETER'S hearers that they were not satisfied with hearing once only, and were not content with the unwritten teaching of the divine Gospel, but with all sorts of entreaties <i>they besought <b>MARK</b>, a follower of Peter, and the one whose Gospel is extant, that he would leave them a written monument of the doctrine which had been orally communicated to them.</i>

<i>Nor did they cease until they had prevailed with the man, and had thus become the occasion of the written Gospel which bears the name of <b>MARK</b>.</i>

<i>And they say that Peter when he had learned, through a revelation of the Spirit, of that which had been done, was pleased with the zeal of the men, and that the work obtained the sanction of his authority for the purpose of being used in the churches.</i>

<b>Clement</b> in the eighth book of his Hypotyposes gives this account, and with him agrees the bishop of Hierapolis named Papias.

And Peter makes mention of Mark in his first epistle which they say that he wrote in Rome itself, as is indicated by him, when he calls the city, by a figure, Babylon, as he does in the following words:

"The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son" (1 Peter 5:13).  And they say that this Mark was the first that was sent to Egypt, and that he proclaimed the Gospel which he had written, and first established churches in Alexandria.\|

Note this would mean "she" who is in Babylon (Rome, similar to the Book of Revelation referring to Rome that way evidently) is the church, not a literal woman.

This same page (on "catholic-resources.org") then has a long quote they say is Eusebius's summary, which also mentions authorship of John, and this looks to be the quote I have heard of that supports "Matthean priority" (i.e. that Matthew was written before Mark, as opposed to the currently popular Markan priority):

\|5b\. "Nevertheless, of all the disciples of the Lord, only Matthew and John have left us written memorials, and they, tradition says, were led to write only under the pressure of necessity. 6. For MATTHEW, who had at first preached to the Hebrews, when he was about to go to other peoples, committed his Gospel to writing in his native tongue, and thus compensated those whom he was obliged to leave for the loss of his presence.

7\. And when MARK and LUKE had already published their Gospels, they say that JOHN, who had employed all his time in proclaiming the Gospel orally, finally proceeded to write for the following reason.

The three Gospels already mentioned having come into the hands of all and into his own too, they say that he accepted them and bore witness to their truthfulness; but that there was lacking in them an account of the deeds done by Christ at the beginning of his ministry.

8\. And this indeed is true. For it is evident that the three evangelists recorded only the deeds done by the Saviour for one year after the imprisonment of John the Baptist, and indicated this in the beginning of their account. 9. For Matthew, after the forty days’ fast and the temptation which followed it, indicates the chronology of his work when he says: “Now when he heard that John was delivered up he withdrew from Judea into Galilee.” 10. Mark likewise says: “Now after that John was delivered up Jesus came into Galilee.” And Luke, before commencing his account of the deeds of Jesus, similarly marks the time, when he says that Herod, “adding to all the evil deeds which he had done, shut up John in prison.”

11\. They say, therefore, that the apostle JOHN, being asked to do it for this reason, gave in his Gospel an account of the period which had been omitted by the earlier evangelists, and of the deeds done by the Saviour during that period; that is, of those which were done before the imprisonment of the Baptist.

And this is indicated by him, they say, in the following words: “This beginning of miracles did Jesus”; and again when he refers to the Baptist, in the midst of the deeds of Jesus, as still baptizing in Ænon near Salim; where he states the matter clearly in the words: “For John was not yet cast into prison.”

12\. John accordingly, in his Gospel, records the deeds of Christ which were performed before the Baptist was cast into prison, but the other three evangelists mention the events which happened after that time.

13\. One who understands this can no longer think that the Gospels are at variance with one another, inasmuch as the Gospel according to John contains the first acts of Christ, while the others give an account of the latter part of his life. And the genealogy of our Saviour according to the flesh John quite naturally omitted, because it had been already given by Matthew and Luke, and began with the doctrine of his divinity, which had, as it were, been reserved for him, as their superior, by the divine Spirit.

14\. These things may suffice, which we have said concerning the Gospel of John. The cause which led to the composition of the Gospel of Mark has been already stated by us.

15\. But as for Luke, in the beginning of his Gospel, he states himself the reasons which led him to write it. He states that since many others had more rashly undertaken to compose a narrative of the events of which he had acquired perfect knowledge, he himself, feeling the necessity of freeing us from their uncertain opinions, delivered in his own Gospel an accurate account of those events in regard to which he had learned the full truth, being aided by his intimacy and his stay with Paul and by his acquaintance with the rest of the apostles. 16a. So much for our own account of these things."\|

Indeed there is more detail about the early events surrounding John the Baptist in John. This wording is a bit weird as it says nothing about the extensive detail about the final events and speech of Jesus leading up to his arrest, but maybe it just means that this was the initial reason John set about the task, and that the other expanded details are of course consistent with that goal.

The page goes on to quote what JPH in his article has covered already that Eusebius seems to want to insist that the apostle John didn't write Revelation. One thing to note, though, is that he lends credence to my theory here:

\|For the evangelist nowhere gives his name, or proclaims himself, either in the Gospel or Epistle.\|

The page has this in italics, in a section titled "citing Dionysius of Alexandria" so I'm guessing this is thought to be a quote of him, rather than Eusebius' words, but in any event, it shows early awareness that authorial avoidance is a mark of John as author.

As for it supposedly being a problem in Revelation, the problem is Revelation is written much later in John's life, during exile on Patmos, when he is already severely persecuted, and there has been a long history of epistles with open signatures within the body text.

Plus Revelation opens with letters to the churches, dictated by Jesus, so there would be a need to distinguish clearly between the words of Christ and those of the human writing them down. Anonymity within body text is not an absolute rule, and he could even be helping to clarify it by eventually using it, when the window for the need for it had closed, and he felt more comfortable that it was embraced as still a valid option within Christianity.

He did also come close, if my theory is right, to a signature within the body text by naming the sons of Zebedee. There is an association of lessening the anonymity near an end, similar to keeping it through his own epistles but dropping the rule in the later apocalypse that contains epistles from Christ.

So I find the idea that John wrote all five of these books internally consistent.

It might not be externally consistent with Eusebius' opinion in the case of Revelation, although there are a few places where he makes it clear this is speculative, but for the authorship of the gospel, it is externally consistent with Eusebius.

And I had listed (which I'll cover below) in my initial notes many similarities in style between the gospel and the three epistles of John. So that Eusebius also isn't disputing Johannine authorship of those four books is significant also for evidencing that John wrote John.

Also keep in mind the evidence shows that the signature was always on the scroll tags for all four works.

The rule about the difference in style between the Mosaic third-person self-references and John's apparent style (and that of Christ in Genesis 1-2:3) isn't that you have to hide that you wrote it, but that you find places where you do make that more implied, and you still clearly and openly sign your name to the work, as I think Christ did in Genesis 2:4, and then in Adam's work, as I think it is, next, there's no shyness about openly using that reference (the LORD God or Yahweh God).

In fact, John might have been influenced by this pattern to see the "rule" as that you eventually drop the anonymity, and that it's okay for others to do so.

There are also at least *three* styles shown to be valid from others -- *first*-person being the third, used by Paul, etc. In first person it was actually normal to refer to yourself openly too, and with no authorial avoidance at all.

That John didn't do this even in his three epistles to me only supports that the same guy focused on authorial avoidance (note I say "avoidance" not total anonymity on purpose) wrote John, which clearly uses it, but he does switch to first person in the epistles. So I see a trend toward embracing the common Christian first-person-non-avoided approach.

The big issue is in historical narration, like Moses telling all these dramatic events he was playing such a lead role in, and then reminding the reader that he was writing about them himself.

In epistles this isn't a problem, yet John *also* uses avoidance there (or whoever wrote them).

It also isn't as much of a problem with prophetic works. Compare to books like Isaiah. It opens within the body text openly self-referencing by name, and again in 2, etc., then after extensive speech from God, in chapter 6 turns to first person. John would be aware of this valid approach too.

In all of this the "exaltation" is clearly directed exclusively to the Lord, both in Isaiah and John. You even see John wrongly so eager to bow that he bows to a mere angel and needs to be corrected. He's still making it crystal clear that he isn't trying to claim too much personal honor.

So I see nothing inconsistent here about John dropping the avoidance within the body text in Revelation.

Notice that Revelation also ends echoing the ending of Isaiah.

This would also, by the way, evidence strong familiarity with the OT by John, again fitting well that he was better educated, although Acts cites opponents claiming he was poorly educated. Comparatively, he probably was, but that isn't just a boolean option (either fully educated or completely uneducated; I'm saying it looks like John was more in-between).

Irenaeus is then cited:

\|Matthew also issued a written Gospel among the Hebrews in their own dialect, while Peter and Paul were preaching at Rome, and laying the foundations of the Church. After their departure, Mark, the disciple and interpreter of Peter, did also hand down to us in writing what had been preached by Peter. Luke also, the companion of Paul, recorded in a book the Gospel preached by him. Afterwards, John, the disciple of the Lord, who also had leaned upon His breast, did himself publish a Gospel during his residence at Ephesus in Asia."\|

Part of which I had quoted from JPH earlier. That page ends; now back to JPH.

He notes detailed knowledge in John of the local geography. This could apply to Lazarus too, though. But perhaps more so for someone from Galilee, who would have to travel further to reach Jerusalem for Passover than Lazarus.

There's a mention of evidence of familiarity with Samaritan "forms of thought." Again, fits well someone who had to travel either through it or around it often.

The mention of the simple references to Bap as "John" is given here, mentioned by me already earlier.

This is worth quoting as it directly supports my authorial avoidance theory about John specifically:

\|Ommission of stories where John is prominent. Blomberg [Blom.Jn, 30] points to a number of Synoptic episodes missing from John in which John plays a role (Mark 1:16-20, 29-32; 3:13-19; 5:35-43, etc.) Though he does not reach this conclusion, we would observe thatleaving out such stories fits in with the ancient dialectic of honor and shame, in which John would be hesitant to report stories in which he was prominent.\|

He reports the use of "professional fisherman's terms." Specifically, at least, the "distinct technical name for cooked fish."

Next JPH cites abundant evidence John was written specifically to complement and be read after Mark. I won't cite it here but much of it looks plausible. This would also help evidence that this is John, since Mark is Peter's top student and John and Peter are obviously often put together. Though note that I think both Luke and John intended their readers to read all two, and then three, previous gospels anyway.

(And if Matthean priority is right, it's quite possible Mark intended them to read Matthew first too, or vice versa if wrong, but I think the evidence best fits, following JPH elsewhere, that Matthew was likely writing live notes already even during Jesus' ministry as his official scribe, similar to the role of Baruch for Jeremiah, and that Matthew's notes were often of what all the apostles verbally repeated often, so in a sense Matthew is composed of both notes and memorized units likely accessible to all three of the other gospel writers.)

Against the idea of contradictory chronologies, JPH writes:

\|We note briefly that the Synoptics offered no clear time markers that demanded such a view. In line with the typical practice of ancient biography, in which words and deeds were the foremost feature, the Synoptics gathered material topically and were not concerned to provide a chronology in the same sense as a modern biography, in which every chapter or paragraph stresses that things happened on such and such a date at 4 in the afternoon (which among the Gospels, only John does to any extent; cf. 1:19, 1:35, 1:39, 1:43, 2;1, 2:13).\|

I'm quoting this more for the list of verses at the end. I haven't checked them, though I did note one of them earlier, but it supports that a very familiar eyewitness wrote it. Not sure it makes as much sense to put Lazarus in those early events listed here. Given that John the Baptist was hanging out in the wilderness and the Jordan, it makes more sense to me that a fisherman would be the unnamed disciple so close to John.

Of course, we do have our weird, possibly unintentional implied argument that Lazarus might be a fisherman in John 21, if we presuppose the DiLoved there is Laz.

For the primary purpose of John, this is relevant:

\|John's Gospel is therefore found to be a "resocializing" document intended to establish ties between the convert and his new "ingroup." To this end it features primarily conversations and monologue, the "main form of discourse used in socialization and reality maintenence" -- thus explaining as well why John does not follow the Synoptics in featuring public teachings and parables. A Sermon on the Mount would not serve John's purpose. The reader is intended to be a "conversation partner" with Jesus and there is nothing at all strange about John's non-usage of parables, which were clearly meant to be consumed by "outsiders".\|

This again would be a natural purpose for one of the three most in-group disciples, Peter, James, or... John. It would seem a little more strange for Lazarus, who clearly didn't normally travel with Jesus, even if he might have been present whenever Jesus was in Bethany, etc.

His comment next at the article's end about "Kingdom of God" being onlyused once in John also implies an in-group focus, consistent with John.

I don't see JPH pages, at least not in the index, for 1/2/3 John. For Revelation, he does link to a GM page that says this in answer to how peasant John wrote in Greek:

\|The short answer is that peasants in the commercial trades (esp. fishing, as was John's and James' occupation) were fluent in everyday Greek...it was the commercial language of the day...John, a native of the villages around the Sea of Galilee, would have had tons of dealings with the Jews in Galilee and with the non-Jews (mostly Greek-speaking) on the east shore of the Sea of Galilee (as would have Peter and James)...

Also, the Greek of John and Revelation is a very SIMPLE style of Greek, without the polish of Hebrews or Paul...It befits a writer who mostly used Greek for business dealings...\|

This would help support that the same author may have written John and Revelation.


### Coop Mode
What if both John and Lazarus wrote John, and Lazarus is sometimes the DiLoved, sometimes John?

Or one wrote it but frequently used the other as a source?

It's possible, at least the "coop" part of this idea, but it seems almost irrelevant to DiLoved's identity or identities re all the above overwhelming evidence. I think more likely John just knew more about Lazarus, and knew Lazarus through Jesus.

But as mentioned earlier, the approach in writing ancient documents seems to have been largely cooperative anyway.

This wouldn't likely involve two people doing the physical writing like we often think of today, but the writer (or author dictating to a scribe) speaking with anyone nearby about what could be added next. Note there was also no expectation of any need to cite them by name like our modern culture has become obsessed with.


### Style Sims Tweenem
Style similarities between them (John and 1/2/3 John).

Since this article has proven to be overlong, I'm going to switch to relying on links in some cases, from some draft content in my notes that I've been otherwise expanding on for the above.

For example, "love," a key word in the very phrase most at issue for this BibleQ, is a common theme and word in the three epistles and the gospel (especially [1st John 4:8](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/1jo/4/8){:target="_blank"} / [4:16](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/1jo/4/16){:target="_blank"} and [John 8:42](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/8/42){:target="_blank"} / [14:21](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/14/21){:target="_blank"},[23](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/14/23){:target="_blank"},[24](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/14/24){:target="_blank"} / [15:9](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/15/9){:target="_blank"},[13](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/15/13){:target="_blank"} and many others). Also found often are light (e.g. [1st John 1:5](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/1jo/1/5){:target="_blank"},[7](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/1jo/1/7){:target="_blank"} and [John 1:4-9](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/1/4){:target="_blank"}), life ([1st John 5:12](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/1jo/5/12){:target="_blank"} and [John 5:26](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/5/26){:target="_blank"} and surrounding 21-29 / [6:33-34](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/6/33){:target="_blank"} & surrounding 27-68), and truth ([2nd John 1:1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/2jo/1/1){:target="_blank"} / [3rd John 1:3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/3jo/1/3){:target="_blank"} and [John 4:23](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/4/23){:target="_blank"} which alludes to all three Persons re [14:6](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/14/6){:target="_blank"} / [1:17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/1/17){:target="_blank"}). Note also the lack of self-attribution in the epistles compared to others' epistles (although Revelation is self-attributed in its body text to John), the phrase /Word of Life/ in [1st John 1:1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/1jo/1/1){:target="_blank"} as an opening very similar to that about the Word in [John 1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/1){:target="_blank"}, and many similar constructions.


## From the Beginning
Now let's start building an understanding of why I think John (and/or Mark; if it's true that John is especially focused on writing a followup to Mark, it may be Mark, or Peter, thought of this first, and John followed Mark's lead) came to value "authorial avoidance."

First let me restate the argument from the version in my notes:

Specifically the argument is that some early Christians took Jesus' focus on Genesis ([Matthew 19:8](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mat/19/8){:target="_blank"}) as a reason to look closely at it as a pattern to follow, and that [Genesis 2:4](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/2/4){:target="_blank"} is a signature line for the preceding account, seeing Jesus as the LORD God there, implying he authored 1-2:3, using "authorial avoidance" of his own personal name within the account's body text itself, and that these early Christians used this model in some of their own works (Mark and John), despite millennia of a tradition of instead referring to oneself in the third person, since the apparent account of Adam from [2:5](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/2/5){:target="_blank"} through [5:1a](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/5/1){:target="_blank"}, and Moses himself ([Exodus 17:14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/exo/17/14){:target="_blank"}, [Numbers 33:1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/num/33/1){:target="_blank"},[2](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/num/33/2){:target="_blank"}), etc.

Though the 3rd-person option also remained valid, as Matthew uses it (compare [Matthew 9:9](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mat/9/9){:target="_blank"} with [Mark 2:14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mar/2/14){:target="_blank"} and [Luke 5:27](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/luk/5/27){:target="_blank"}). And sometimes first person as with Luke's openings of both [Luke](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/luk/1/3){:target="_blank"} and [Acts](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/act/1/1){:target="_blank"}.

Also, probably not coincidentally, Mark was said (by Papias as quoted by Eusebius, and by Clement) to be a top student of Peter, and Peter and John were two of the three disciples normally treated as central (e.g. [Matthew 17:1-8](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mat/17/1){:target="_blank"}), and closest to Jesus. So basically they adopted what they saw as Jesus' own authorship style.

An absolutely crucial passage for Christians, for understanding how we should still look at the Mosaic law for guidance, yet know which parts don't stand in the Christian covenant, is revealed by Jesus here:

Matthew 19:

/3 Pharisees came to him, testing him and saying, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?”

4 He answered, “Haven’t you read that he who made them <b><i><u>FROM THE BEGINNING</u></i></b> made them male and female,* 5  and said, ‘For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh’?* 6  So that they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, don’t let man tear apart.”

7 They asked him, “Why then did Moses command us to give her a certificate of divorce and divorce her?”

8 He said to them, “Moses, **because of the hardness of your hearts**, allowed you to divorce your wives, but <b><i><u>FROM THE BEGINNING</u></i></b> it has not been so./

When someone repeats something, it's important, and all the more so in their culture.

Mark version, chapter 10:

/2 Pharisees came to him testing him, and asked him, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?”

3 He answered, “What did Moses command you?”

4 They said, “Moses allowed a certificate of divorce to be written, and to divorce her.”

5 But Jesus said to them, “For your hardness of heart, he wrote you this commandment.

6  But <b><i><u>FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE CREATION</u></i></b>, God made them male and female.* 7  For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will join to his wife, 8  and the two will become one flesh,* so that they are no longer two, but one flesh. 9  What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate.”/

(By the way, Mark's wording rules out Old-Eartherism.)

This gave Christians our interpretive key to know how to tell what among the highly-detailed Mosaic Covenant still stands in the Christian Covenant, along with other context shown earlier showing that the Mosiac itself ended -- we look to what in it is consistent with the original pattern in early Genesis.

This is why God took six whole days to create rather than creating in an instant; to demonstrate to us that we should also work six days and then rest on the Sabbath, and that this Sabbath rest, while partially to show devotion to God, was not against man, but for him.

Matthew 12

/8  For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”

9 He departed from there and went into their synagogue. 10 And behold, there was a man with a withered hand. They asked him, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day?” so that they might accuse him.

11 He said to them, “What man is there among you who has one sheep, and if this one falls into a pit on the Sabbath day, won’t he grab on to it and lift it out? 12  Of how much more value then is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath day.”

13 Then he told the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out; and it was restored whole, just like the other./

Mark 2:

/1 When he entered again into Capernaum after some days, it was heard that he was at home.

2 Immediately many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even around the door; and he spoke the word to them. 3 Four people came, carrying a paralytic to him. 4 When they could not come near to him for the crowd, they removed the roof where he was. When they had broken it up, they let down the mat that the paralytic was lying on.

5 Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven you.”

6 But there were some of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts, 7 “Why does this man speak blasphemies like that? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”

8 Immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said to them, “Why do you reason these things in your hearts? 9  Which is easier, to tell the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven;’ or to say, ‘Arise, and take up your bed, and walk’? 10  But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—he said to the paralytic— 11  “I tell you, arise, take up your mat, and go to your house.”

12 He arose, and immediately took up the mat and went out in front of them all, so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, “We never saw anything like this!”

...

23 He was going on the Sabbath day through the grain fields; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of grain.

24 The Pharisees said to him, “Behold, why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day?”

25 He said to them, “Did you never read what David did when he had need and was hungry—he, and those who were with him? 26  How he entered into God’s house at the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the show bread, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and gave also to those who were with him?”

27 He said to them, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. 28  Therefore the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.”/

See also [Luke 6:1-11](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/luk/6/1){:target="_blank"}.

Exodus 20:

/8 “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.

9 You shall labor six days, and do all your work, 10 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God.

You shall not do any work in it, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your livestock, nor your stranger who is within your gates; 11 <b><i><u>FOR</u></i></b> in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day; <b><i><u>THEREFORE</u></i></b> Yahweh blessed the Sabbath day, and made it holy./

What all of this means is that from the beginning of creation, the Sabbath was for man, but as part of the ceremonial law for signing onto the Mosaic covenant, you were to take it to what might otherwise be an "extreme," unless there was a legitimate reason for an exception -- and that one the Mosaic covenant ended when John prepared the way for the Lord, we return to how it originally was to be.

Luke 16:

/14 The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, also heard all these things, and they scoffed at him.

15 He said to them, “You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts. For that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.

16  “The law and the prophets were until John. From that time the Good News of God’s Kingdom is preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it. 17  But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one tiny stroke of a pen in the law to fall.

18  “Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery. He who marries one who is divorced from a husband commits adultery./

There's a lot of relevance there, one of the keys being that the standing Old-Testament system, with the Mosaic covenant, began to be turned back to the Abrahamic covenant only, as the Christian covenant was being established.


### Accomplished

This process was completed once Jesus finished all that he had to accomplish:

Matthew 5:

/13  “You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has lost its flavor, with what will it be salted? It is then good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men.

14  You are the light of the world. A city located on a hill can’t be hidden. 15  Neither do you light a lamp and put it under a measuring basket, but on a stand; and it shines to all who are in the house. 16  Even so, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven.

17  <b>“Don’t think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets. I didn’t come to destroy, but to fulfill. 18  For most certainly, I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not even one smallest letter‡ or one tiny pen stroke§ shall in any way pass away from the law, <u>until all things are accomplished.</u></b>

19  Therefore, whoever shall break one of these least commandments and teach others to do so, shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven; but whoever shall do and teach them shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven.

20  <b>For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, there is no way you will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</b>

21  “You have heard that it was said to the ancient ones, ‘You shall not murder;’* and ‘Whoever murders will be in danger of the judgment.’ 22  But I tell you that everyone who is angry with his brother without a cause † will be in danger of the judgment. Whoever says to his brother, ‘Raca!’ ‡ will be in danger of the council. Whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be in danger of the fire of Gehenna.§

23  “If therefore you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has anything against you, 24  leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. 25  Agree with your adversary quickly while you are with him on the way; lest perhaps the prosecutor deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison. 26  Most certainly I tell you, you shall by no means get out of there until you have paid the last penny.†

27  “You have heard that it was said, ‡ ‘You shall not commit adultery;’* 28  but I tell you that everyone who gazes at a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart. 29  If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna.§ 30  If your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off, and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish, than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna.†

31  “It was also said, ‘Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorce,’* 32  but I tell you that whoever puts away his wife, except for the cause of sexual immorality, makes her an adulteress; and whoever marries her when she is put away commits adultery.

33  “Again you have heard that it was said to the ancient ones, ‘You shall not make false vows, but shall perform to the Lord your vows,’* 34  but I tell you, don’t swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God; 35  nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. 36  Neither shall you swear by your head, for you can’t make one hair white or black. 37  But let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes’ and your ‘No’ be ‘No.’ Whatever is more than these is of the evil one.

38  “You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.’* 39  But I tell you, don’t resist him who is evil; but whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also. 40  If anyone sues you to take away your coat, let him have your cloak also. 41  Whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two. 42  Give to him who asks you, and don’t turn away him who desires to borrow from you.

43  “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor * and hate your enemy.’‡ 44  But I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you, 45  that you may be children of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust. 46  For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Don’t even the tax collectors do the same? 47  If you only greet your friends, what more do you do than others? Don’t even the tax collectors§ do the same? 48  Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect./

Back to the foundational Matthew 19:

/9  I tell you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and he who marries her when she is divorced commits adultery.”

10 His disciples said to him, “If this is the case of the man with his wife, it is not expedient to marry.”

11 But he said to them, “Not all men can receive this saying, but those to whom it is given. 12  For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven’s sake. He who is able to receive it, let him receive it.”

13 Then little children were brought to him that he should lay his hands on them and pray; and the disciples rebuked them. 14 But Jesus said, “Allow the little children, and don’t forbid them to come to me; for the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to ones like these.” 15 He laid his hands on them, and departed from there.

16 Behold, one came to him and said, “Good teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?”

17 He said to him, “Why do you call me good?† No one is good but one, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.”

18 He said to him, “Which ones?”

Jesus said, “ ‘You shall not murder.’ ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ ‘You shall not steal.’ ‘You shall not offer false testimony.’ 19  ‘Honor your father and your mother.’* And, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ ”*

20 The young man said to him, “All these things I have observed from my youth. What do I still lack?”

21 Jesus said to him, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.”

22 But when the young man heard this, he went away sad, for he was one who had great possessions.

23 Jesus said to his disciples, “Most certainly I say to you, a rich man will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven with difficulty. 24  Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to enter into God’s Kingdom.”

25 When the disciples heard it, they were exceedingly astonished, saying, <b>“Who then can be saved?”</b>

26 <b>Looking at them, Jesus said, “With men this is impossible, but <u>with God all things are possible</u>.”</b>

27 Then Peter answered, “Behold, we have left everything and followed you. What then will we have?”

28 Jesus said to them, “Most certainly I tell you that you who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on the throne of his glory, you also will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

29  Everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, will receive one hundred times, and will inherit eternal life. 30  But many will be last who are first, and first who are last./

Remember the disciples did not yet understand the atonement Christ would provide for them on the cross.

"With God all things are possible" isn't just some catchy saying meant to make you feel good; it's saying you need the in-dwelling Holy Spirit as the rest of the NT makes clearer, and God can't stand to abide in you until Christ has paid the price for your sin.

This is an allusion to the need for atonement, bringing us back to God -- so we're then *with* God, and we don't *need* to earn our salvation.

Jesus isn't saying only rich people have trouble entering the Kingdom; he's saying "with men" (as in people trying to earn our way to heaven) it's *impossible*, but that isn't our only option, and this is a crucial part of why he Incarnated.

Mark's version, chapter 10 continued:

/10 In the house, his disciples asked him again about the same matter. 11 He said to them, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her. 12  If a woman herself divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.”

13 They were bringing to him little children, that he should touch them, but the disciples rebuked those who were bringing them.

14 But when Jesus saw it, he was moved with indignation and said to them, “Allow the little children to come to me! Don’t forbid them, for God’s Kingdom belongs to such as these. 15  Most certainly I tell you, whoever will not receive God’s Kingdom like a little child, he will in no way enter into it.” 16 He took them in his arms and blessed them, laying his hands on them.

17 As he was going out into the way, one ran to him, knelt before him, and asked him, “Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?”

18 Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except one—God. 19  You know the commandments: ‘Do not murder,’ ‘Do not commit adultery,’ ‘Do not steal,’ ‘Do not give false testimony,’ ‘Do not defraud,’ ‘Honor your father and mother.’ ”*
20 He said to him, “Teacher, I have observed all these things from my youth.”

21 Jesus looking at him loved him, and said to him, “One thing you lack. Go, sell whatever you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me, taking up the cross.”

22 But his face fell at that saying, and he went away sorrowful, for he was one who had great possessions.

23 Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How difficult it is for those who have riches to enter into God’s Kingdom!”

24 The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus answered again, “Children, how hard it is for those who trust in riches to enter into God’s Kingdom! 25  It is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to enter into God’s Kingdom.”

26 They were exceedingly astonished, saying to him, “Then who can be saved?”

27 Jesus, looking at them, said, “With men it is impossible, but not with God, for all things are possible with God.”

28 Peter began to tell him, “Behold, we have left all and have followed you.”

29 Jesus said, “Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or land, for my sake, and for the sake of the Good News, 30  but he will receive one hundred times more now in this time: houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and land, with persecutions; and in the age to come eternal life. 31  But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”

32 They were on the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going in front of them, and they were amazed; and those who followed were afraid.

He again took the twelve, and began to tell them the things that were going to happen to him.

33  “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death, and will deliver him to the Gentiles. 34  They will mock him, spit on him, scourge him, and kill him. On the third day he will rise again.”/


### The Necessary Suffering of Christ's Soul

Luke 13:

/13 Behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was sixty stadia† from Jerusalem.

14 They talked with each other about all of these things which had happened.

15 While they talked and questioned together, Jesus himself came near, and went with them. 16 But their eyes were kept from recognizing him. 17 He said to them, “What are you talking about as you walk, and are sad?”

18 One of them, named Cleopas, answered him, “Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who doesn’t know the things which have happened there in these days?”

19 He said to them, “What things?”

They said to him, “The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people; 20 and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. 21 But we were hoping that it was he who would redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened.

22 Also, certain women of our company amazed us, having arrived early at the tomb; 23 and when they didn’t find his body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. 24 Some of us went to the tomb and found it just like the women had said, but they didn’t see him.”

25 He said to them, “Foolish people, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken! 26  Didn’t the Christ have to suffer these things and to enter into his glory?”

27 <b>Beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he explained to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself</b>./

Mark 16:

/11 When they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, <b>they disbelieved</b>.

12 After these things he was revealed in another form to two of them as they walked, on their way into the country. 13 They went away and told it to the rest. <b>They didn’t believe them, either</b>./

Isaiah 53:

/<b>1 Who has believed our message?</b><br>
To whom has Yahweh’s arm been revealed?<br>
2 For he grew up before him as a tender plant,<br>
and as a root out of dry ground.<br>
He has no good looks or majesty.<br>
When we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.<br>
3 He was despised<br>
and rejected by men,<br>
a man of suffering<br>
and acquainted with disease.<br>
He was despised as one from whom men hide their face;<br>
and we didn’t respect him.<br>
 
4 Surely he has borne our sickness<br>
and carried our suffering;<br>
yet we considered him plagued,<br>
struck by God, and afflicted.<br>
5 But he was pierced for our transgressions.<br>
He was crushed for our iniquities.<br>
The punishment that brought our peace was on him;<br>
and by his wounds we are healed.<br>
6 All we like sheep have gone astray.<br>
Everyone has turned to his own way;<br>
and Yahweh has laid on him the iniquity of us all.<br>
 
7 He was oppressed,<br>
yet when he was afflicted he didn’t open his mouth.<br>
As a lamb that is led to the slaughter,<br>
and as a sheep that before its shearers is silent,<br>
so he didn’t open his mouth.<br>
8 He was taken away by oppression and judgment.<br>
As for his generation,<br>
who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living<br>
and stricken for the disobedience of my people?<br>
9 They made his grave with the wicked,<br>
and with a rich man in his death,<br>
although he had done no violence,<br>
nor was any deceit in his mouth.<br>
 
10 Yet it pleased Yahweh to bruise him.<br>
He has caused him to suffer.<br>
<b>When you make his soul an offering for sin</b>,<br>
he will see his offspring.<br>
<b>He will prolong his days</b><br>
and Yahweh’s pleasure will prosper in his hand.<br>
<b>11 After the suffering of his soul,<br>
he will see the light† and be satisfied.</b><br>
My righteous servant will justify many by the knowledge of himself;<br>
and he will bear their iniquities.<br>
12 Therefore I will give him a portion with the great.<br>
He will divide the plunder with the strong,<br>
because he poured out his soul to death<br>
and was counted with the transgressors;<br>
yet he bore the sins of many<br>
and made intercession for the transgressors./

Remember that "soul" (Hb nephesh Ln NEH-fesh) in OT is body + spirit. Spirit (Hb ruakh Ln RUE-ahkh) is the intangible aspect of a living thing, the immateriality (like information, but including emotions, thoughts, will, etc.) with dynamic continuity, and both words are poetically (and in Hebrew etymologically) rooted to breath, wind.

Genesis 2:

/7 Yahweh God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed (root: nephesh) into his nostrils the breath (root: nephesh) of life; and man became a living soul (root: nephesh)./

Genesis 1:

/2 The earth was formless and empty. Darkness was on the surface of the deep and God’s Spirit (ruakh) was hovering over the surface of the waters./

Genesis 6:

/17 I, even I, will bring the flood of waters on this earth, to destroy all flesh having the breath (ruakh) of life from under the sky. Everything that is in the earth will die./

Genesis 8:

/1 God remembered Noah, all the animals, and all the livestock that were with him in the ship; and God made a wind (ruakh) to pass over the earth. The waters subsided./

In other words, Isaiah prophesied the Messiah's death and resurrection.

Why?

Isaiah says it as quoted above, several times. Let's continue:


### IT IS FINISHED

Matthew 27:

/46 About the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, “Eli, Eli, lima‡ sabachthani?” That is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”*/

Mark 15:

/34 At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?” which is, being interpreted, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” */

This was Jesus predicting his vindication by alluding to this entire Psalm by quoting its opening passage (opening passages were used as titles throughout ANE cultures, thus for example "In the beginning" giving the Hebrew title of the Book of Genesis; Beginning):

Psalm 22:

/For the Chief Musician; set to “The Doe of the Morning.” A Psalm by David.<br>
1 <b>My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?</b><br>
Why are you so far from helping me, and from the words of my groaning?<br>
2 My God, I cry in the daytime, but you don’t answer;<br>
in the night season, and am not silent.<br>
3 But you are holy,<br>
you who inhabit the praises of Israel.<br>
4 Our fathers trusted in you.<br>
They trusted, and you delivered them.<br>
5 They cried to you, and were delivered.<br>
They trusted in you, and were not disappointed.<br>
6 But I am a worm, and no man;<br>
a reproach of men, and despised by the people.<br>
7 All those who see me mock me.<br>
They insult me with their lips. They shake their heads, saying,<br>
8 “He trusts in Yahweh.<br>
Let him deliver him.<br>
Let him rescue him, since he delights in him.”<br>
9 But you brought me out of the womb.<br>
You made me trust while at my mother’s breasts.<br>
10 I was thrown on you from my mother’s womb.<br>
You are my God since my mother bore me.<br>
11 Don’t be far from me, for trouble is near.<br>
For there is no one to help.<br>
12 Many bulls have surrounded me.<br>
Strong bulls of Bashan have encircled me.<br>
13 They open their mouths wide against me,<br>
lions tearing prey and roaring.<br>
14 I am poured out like water.<br>
All my bones are out of joint.<br>
My heart is like wax.<br>
It is melted within me.<br>
15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd.<br>
My tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth.<br>
You have brought me into the dust of death.<br>
16 For dogs have surrounded me.<br>
A company of evildoers have enclosed me.<br>
They have pierced my hands and feet.†<br>
17 I can count all of my bones.<br>
They look and stare at me.<br>
18 They divide my garments among them.<br>
They cast lots for my clothing.<br>
 
19 But don’t be far off, Yahweh.<br>
You are my help. Hurry to help me!<br>
20 Deliver my soul from the sword,<br>
my precious life from the power of the dog.<br>
21 Save me from the lion’s mouth!<br>
Yes, you have rescued me from the horns of the wild oxen.<br>
 
22 I will declare your name to my brothers.<br>
Among the assembly, I will praise you.<br>
23 You who fear Yahweh, praise him!<br>
All you descendants of Jacob, glorify him!<br>
Stand in awe of him, all you descendants of Israel!<br>
24 <b>For he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted,<br>
neither has he hidden his face from him;<br>
but when he cried to him, he heard.</b><br>
 
25 My praise of you comes in the great assembly.<br>
I will pay my vows before those who fear him.<br>
26 <b>The humble shall eat and be satisfied.<br>
They shall praise Yahweh who seek after him.<br>
Let your hearts live forever.</b><br>
27 All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to Yahweh.<br>
All the relatives of the nations shall worship before you.<br>
28 For the kingdom is Yahweh’s.<br>
He is the ruler over the nations.<br>
29 All the rich ones of the earth shall eat and worship.<br>
<b>All those who go down to the dust shall bow before him,<br>
even he who can’t keep his soul alive.</b><br>
30 Posterity shall serve him.<br>
Future generations shall be told about the Lord.<br>
31 They shall come and shall declare his righteousness to a people that shall be born,<br>
<b><i><u>FOR HE HAS DONE IT</u></i></b>./

Matthew 27:

/50 <b>Jesus cried again with <i>a loud voice</i>, and yielded up his spirit</b>./

Mark 15:

/37 <b>Jesus cried out with <i>a loud voice</i>, and gave up the spirit</b>./

Luke 23:

/46 <b>Jesus, crying with <i>a loud voice</i>, said, “Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!” Having said this, he breathed his last</b>./

John 19:

/25 But **standing by Jesus’ cross** were his mother, his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. 26 Therefore when **Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing there**, he said to his mother, “Woman, behold, your son!” 27 Then he said to the disciple, “Behold, your mother!” From that hour, the disciple took her to his own home.

...

30 When <b>Jesus</b> therefore had received the vinegar, <b>he said, “<i><u>IT IS FINISHED!</u></i>” Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit</b>./

It's thought that the thrice-repeated "loud voice" means that witnesses standing further away heard that he said something and it was loud, but they couldn't make it out but some of what he said was reported selectively from others close by, and John puts his version in parallel to make it clear that "It is finished!" is what he directly witnessed, up close, was what Jesus said in that loud voice. I agree this makes sense.

Matthew 5 again:

/17  <b>“Don’t think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets. I didn’t come to destroy, but to fulfill. 18  For most certainly, I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not even one smallest letter‡ or one tiny pen stroke§ shall in any way pass away from the law, <u>until all things are accomplished.</u></b>/

Remember what we read about John's purpose in writing the gospel according to Eusebius. If this is correct, that he was writting supplemental material to the other three gospels, it can hardly be overstated the significance of this.

I see signs that Mark and John were reading the Old Testament *very closely,* especially anything about Jesus, and alluding to it.

John was explaining what the loud voice said, and it explains what Jesus meant about "until all things are accomplished." This happened at the cross, because only then could our sin be dealt with in a way other than simply sending us all to hell with no hope.

Now we're getting closer to our significance to Genesis.


### John Read Genesis Attentively

How did John start? Quite "oddly," it might seem, to a modern's eye not reading so closely.

John 1:

/1 <b><u>In the beginning</u> was the Word, and <i>the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 The same was in the beginning with God</i>.</b>

3 <b>All things were made through him. Without him, nothing was made that has been made. 4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 <u>The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasn’t overcome† it</u></b>.

6 There came a man sent from God, whose name was John. 7 The same came as a witness, that he might testify about the light, that all might believe through him. 8 <b>He was not the light, but was sent that he might testify about the light. 9 The true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world.</b>

10 He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world didn’t recognize him. 11 He came to his own, and those who were his own didn’t receive him. 12 But as many as received him, to them he gave the right to become God’s children, to those who believe in his name: 13 who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.

14 The Word became flesh and lived among us. We saw his glory, such glory as of the only born‡ Son of the Father, full of grace and truth.

15 John testified about him. He cried out, saying, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me has surpassed me, for he was before me.’ ” 16 From his fullness we all received grace upon grace. 17 <b>For the law was given through Moses. Grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ</b>.§ 

18 No one has seen God at any time. The only born† Son,‡ who is in the bosom of the Father, has declared him.

19 This is John’s testimony, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”

20 He declared, and didn’t deny, but he declared, “I am not the Christ.”

21 They asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?”

He said, “I am not.”

“Are you the prophet?”

He answered, “No.”

22 They said therefore to him, “Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”

23 He said, “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’* as Isaiah the prophet said.”

24 The ones who had been sent were from the Pharisees. 25 They asked him, “Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?”

26 John answered them, “I baptize in water, but among you stands one whom you don’t know. 27 He is the one who comes after me, who is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I’m not worthy to loosen.” 28 These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.

29 The next day, he saw Jesus coming to him, and said, “Behold,§ the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! 30 This is he of whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who is preferred before me, for he was before me.’ 31 I didn’t know him, but for this reason I came baptizing in water, that he would be revealed to Israel.”

32 John testified, saying, “I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven, and it remained on him. 33 I didn’t recognize him, but he who sent me to baptize in water said to me, ‘On whomever you will see the Spirit descending and remaining on him is he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.’ 34 I have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God.”

35 Again, the next day, John was standing with two of his disciples, 36 and he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!” 37 The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus./

This about light and about the Christ being who God created the universe through might seem like out of the blue new revelation, but it isn't. It's crystal clear in Genesis:

Genesis 1:

/1 <b><u>In the beginning</u>, <i>God† created the heavens and the earth</i></b>. 2 The earth was formless and empty. <b><u>Darkness</u> was on the surface of the <u>deep</u> and <u>God’s Spirit</u> was hovering over the surface of the <u>waters</u></b>.

3 <b><u>God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 4 God saw the light, and saw that it was good. God divided the light from the darkness. 5 God called the light “day”, and the darkness he called “night”.</u></b> There was evening and there was morning, the first day.

6 God said, “Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.” 7 <u>God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse</u>; and it was so. 8 God called the expanse “sky”. There was evening and there was morning, a second day.

9 God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear;” and it was so. 10 God called the dry land “earth”, and the gathering together of the waters he called “seas”. God saw that it was good. 11 God said, “Let the earth yield grass, herbs yielding seeds, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with their seeds in it, on the earth;” and it was so. 12 The earth yielded grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with their seeds in it, after their kind; and God saw that it was good. 13 There was evening and there was morning, a third day.

14 God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs to mark seasons, days, and years; 15 and let them be for lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth;” and it was so. 16 God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He also made the stars. 17 God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light to the earth, 18 and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. God saw that it was good. 19 There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.

20 God said, “Let the waters abound with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the sky.” 21 God created the large sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind. God saw that it was good. 22 God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.” 23 There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.

24 God said, “Let the earth produce living creatures after their kind, livestock, creeping things, and animals of the earth after their kind;” and it was so. 25 God made the animals of the earth after their kind, and the livestock after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind. God saw that it was good.

26 <b><i>God</i> said, “<i>Let’s</i> make man in our image, after our likeness.</b> Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the sky, and over the livestock, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”

27 <b><i>God created man</i> in his own image. In <i>God</i>’s image <i>he created him</i>; male and female <i>he created them</i>.</b>

28 God blessed them. God said to them, “Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the sky, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”

29 God said, “Behold,‡ I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree, which bears fruit yielding seed. It will be your food. 30 To every animal of the earth, and to every bird of the sky, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food;” and it was so.

31 <i>God saw everything that he had made</i>, and, behold, it was very good. There was evening and there was morning, a sixth day.

2:

/1 The heavens, the earth, and all their vast array were <b><i><u>FINISHED</u></i></b>. 2 On the seventh day God <b><i><u>FINISHED</u></i></b> his work which he had done; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done.

3 God blessed the seventh day, and made it holy, because he rested in it from all his work of creation which he had done.

4 <b>This is the history of the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that <i>Yahweh† God</i> made the earth and the heavens.</b>

5 No plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Yahweh God had not caused it to rain on the earth. There was not a man to till the ground, 6 but a mist went up from the earth, and watered the whole surface of the ground.

7 <b><i>Yahweh God</i> formed man</b> from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul./

On the hypothesis of sig-after-until-Abraham (SAUA), everything fits.

John explicitly alludes to all the major features of this section -- and if SAUA, then he is observing that Genesis 2:4 is an end signature line -- the perspective before it is of "the LORD God" as many translations have it, or Yahweh God as WEBP and LSV.

If sig-always-before (SAB), admittedly it makes sense that the term "Yahweh God" suddenly shows up in 2:4 and then continues. But this *also* makes sense if Adam authored the next account and was alluding to this reference for the pre-incarnate Christ.

NO ONE HAS SEEN GOD. Remember we just read that in John 1:18. That means John believes that the one who walked in the Garden was not God the Father, but the Son of God -- yet also in a sense God, because he *is* God, so John is seeing this interchangeable-yet-not tension between these two sections.

That means he realizes that what Adam calls the one he speaks with personally is the one who told Adam about the details of creation Adam wasn't there yet to see (and God's POV of the ones he was), then we get Adam's account.

I think John understood all this -- and he noticed that it means Jesus was avoiding mention of himself within HIS account.

Scroll up and read it again.

Notice several places where it says that God made the things that the one called simply God said "Let US make," and that in MOST cases, this is avoided.


### The Genesis Light Source

Notice also that the Spirit is stated, but then mysteriously seems to be missing.

Notice how a Hebrew would understand the parallelisms in this section:

Genesis 1:

/2 The earth was formless and empty. Darkness was on the surface of the deep and God’s Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters.

3 God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 4 God saw the light, and saw that it was good. God divided the light from the darkness./

Throughout the Bible, "deep" is a synonym for a large body of water such as the Mediterranean (the "deep" that Israelites primarily were around), and can refer to oceans.

Note:

Genesis 1:

/9 God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear;” and it was so./

From this it's commonly thought (as the findings related to Dr. John Baumgardner's Flood model appear to clearly confirm) that there was originally a single supercontinent, broken up during the Flood, and thus a single super-ocean as well. Prior to land, it was just all water on the surface, thus "earth" (dry land per verse 10) was "formless and void" or empty.

What was over the water? It's unclear if there was air yet; that may be what was primarily added on Day 2, but in any case, we do know two things above the water, as the parallelism shows:

||darkness|was|on|the surface of|the deep|
|(and)|God's Spirit|was|hovering over|the surface of|the waters|

In other words, the Spirit was dark -- not shining, not making light yet.

This in turns mean that the Spirit of God / God's Spirit, the Holy Spirit was the source of light in the next few verses!

Now, again, the Spirit is said to have inspired all Scripture. Cites to that end are in the next section (SAUA section).

That means he had, as I say there, an implied authorial role in Genesis 1 through 2:4 as well.

He doesn't need to sign the account, and it's more "okay" to put his name (or a name for him) within the account, unlike the Word, but there's still partial authorial avoidance by the Spirit.

Notice also the "loud voice" is what John picks up on to reveal what Jesus said (it is finished). This according to a source I follow, Anthony Rogers, is actually referring to a title for the theophany of the Son in the garden; that it isn't just that they heard the audible voice of the theophany of God, but that the theophany was titled the Voice of God.

This is likely a big part of where John (Philo, etc.) God the idea that the one we now know as the Son is the "Word" / Logos / Memra, and it further evidences that John is seeing the one who speaks as the Word. Yet the words in Genesis are attributed to the one called simply God (the NT also tends to prefer this term as a concise option for the Father, though at times it refers to the shared essence or being as when the Word IS God).

So the idea here is that the Father was Breathing Out the Voice/Word, when he breathed out the voice/word of each instruction he said, and the Voice/Word then carried out those very instructions, through the Spirit.

So, Father (unchanging God) constantly "emits" the radiance of his being, his intrinsic and beginningless wisdom and the ideas that can be expressed as words, which have always been personified, and his action principle (the Spirit). Carrying with Him, the Word/Wisdom/Son expresses specific instructions and carries them out, acting as a sort of directing agent for the direct creative action of the Spirit.

This is what Genesis teaches, if SAUA, and it also just happens to be what the NT teaches in extreme levels of detail.

And all of it directly supports that John saw these details and learned authorial avoidance.

So it's very clear that John used the cases of avoidance as self-reference without the name, much like Christ did in his account of creation.

In John's case, the phrase he picked as the self-reference appears to be based on the significant statement Jesus said during the first incident where in the account of it the author of the gospel of John uses the "disciple Jesus loved" phrase (DiLoved).

Remember, in the <i>He</i>Loved section about Lazarus, there's nothing anonymous about it.

I see in this, as said near the start of this article, thus, John expressing his newfound style of phrasing, in paraphrasing the messengers, not a hint that DiLoved is Lazarus.

So, John is seeing, due to authorial avoidance and Christ's signed authorship of Genesis 1-2:4, that the <b>Son</b> is the Light that shone out through the Spirit over the waters.

Without these premises, you don't naturally get to the conclusion John clearly reached that led him to phrase things as he did.

It's certainly possible John was revealing new information, but let's give God the grace of the ability to speak clearly using the rules of the initial target "language culture" -- the rules that *do* lead to these conclusions, even if they might not seem immediately obvious if you aren't paying close attention, as John would.


### Sig-After-Until-Abe - Genesis Toledoth Lines Theory (SAUA)

From my prep notes for this article, some sections I felt are good enough to include, with more detail about why I think SAUA makes by far the most sense.

Starting with one paragraph that introduced two sections (about "from the beginning," now expanded a lot above), the first of which is about SAUA:

Since Jesus focused on "from the beginning" as an important doctrinal tool to discern what in the Law of Moses still stands for Christians (e.g. [Matthew 19:8](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mat/19/8){:target="_blank"}), an emphasis Paul also taught in Romans 1 (likely following Christ's taught emphasis to his disciples, then passed on to Paul), in [20](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/rom/1/20){:target="_blank"}, [23](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/rom/1/23){:target="_blank"}, [25](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/rom/1/25){:target="_blank"}, [26](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/rom/1/26){:target="_blank"}, [27](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/rom/1/27){:target="_blank"}, it seems that the very well-studied students of Christ (John) and of his apostles (Mark, student of Peter) looked very closely at Genesis and noticed the phrasing that clearly implies these two things:

First, that Christ himself, the beginningless Son of God, or Word (Logos) of God as Philo also says (an extrabiblical NT-era Jewish source), authored Genesis 1 through 2:3.

And likely [2:4](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/2/4/s_1047020){:target="_blank"} as closing signature line (containing the word "toledoth," sometimes thought to merely mean generations, but likely means "account"), though one prominent interpreter of Genesis, Jonathan Sarfati, in his book *The Genesis Account*, credibly argues, (although I think unsuccessfully), that all such lines go with the sections following them, not before them, and are likely merely transitional statements by Moses, though he acknowledges Moses may have used sources.

I think that Moses likely compiled accounts, possibly accurately preserved from memory originally prior to the invention of writing, and this seems to be explicitly confirmed in the case of the toledoth line in [Genesis 5:1a](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/5/1/s_1047020){:target="_blank"}, which adds that it is the "book of" the toledoth of Adam, which likely should be read as implied to apply to all the other toledoth lines too.

The perspectives match "sig-after" (toledoth lines as signatures after the accounts they go with) -- for example, only God witnesses creation before Day 6 -- up through the Abraham section, which has no toledoth, as the first one to be very long, so an end-signature first became less useful, then later shifted to usually sig-before.
  
Sarfati seems to assume that they all have to be one or the other, but we don't do that with modern sources; some are after, some before, and as far as I've been able to find, nobody has ever supported a universal rule with any evidence at all.
  
And the norm in clay tablets for short accounts in the Ancient Near East (ANE) is sig-after.
  
Until the Abraham account, the sections were short enough to work for that, but the Abe account is much too long for it.

The "signature" purpose may also have been Moses citing his source, rather than part of the original account per se, but that works out to the same thing (not merely a transitional statement).
  
This could make sense if the accounts were originally oral, and whose account it was would be credited outside of the account itself, and later was added into attribution lines at the end of clay tablets (such end-sigs are called colophons), used as sources possibly by Moses, or at least the pattern of them could have been emulated by him.

The only exception where this pattern doesn't seem initially to fit is in the Naamah genealogy in chapter 4, if Naamah is Noah's wife, as I think is clearly implied.
  
Based on the number of names, and timing of similarities in styles in different eras between her and his genealogies (a common trend throughout biblical history), Naamah likely was born after the death of Adam.
  
However, it's clear that genealogical information was later updated into earlier accounts by someone else in the chain of curation of the accounts (authors of later accounts in Genesis, or compiler if as late as Moses).
  
This is seen most clearly in the two Esau genealogies ([36:1-8](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/36/1){:target="_blank"} listing his sons, then [9-43](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mat/19/8){:target="_blank"} repeating the list of his sons and adding other later descendants).
  
Genealogies also usually start an account, establishing credentials of the author, so the style change from [4:17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/4/17){:target="_blank"} to 18 likely is the start of a later brief account of Naamah added by Noah, or kept separately and compiled in by Moses or any of the other curators between them, such as Shem.
  
The style also changes back at [4:25](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/4/25), so this is likely Adam's authorship again, continuing through the /This is the book of the generations of Adam/ part ([5:1a](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/5/1){:target="_blank"}) of Genesis 5.

Then a review summary of events from the earlier accounts is begun in 5:1b, also common after toledoth lines, indicating it is preserving an original account verbatim, not Moses merely using sources loosely. (Yet another basic point Sarfati does not even engage with.)

In effect, Moses' use of these statements does turn them into transitions, but it's clear this is a lesser purpose.

Also, the only case that looks like a transition is a major purpose is [Genesis 10:1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/10/1){:target="_blank"} (sons of "them" makes the last part clearly not the start of a later account, nor "the sons of Noah", and the first mention of the sons in the following verses has no break).
  
This just happens to be the only one where the authorship, under the sig-after-until-Abe view, includes the same person (Shem) for the account both before and after.
  
It's clear that before it, Shem was writing with help from Ham and Japheth, and after it he wrote his own contribution, so both would indeed have been a single account likely from the start, or he could have done the second one as an update and edited the original wording of what is now Genesis 10:1 (such an edit is much more likely for the original author than a later curator, given the clear evidence mentioned above that later curators/authors preserved prior accounts verbatim to a "fault").

Early Christians following the "noble Berean" approach ([Acts 17:10-11](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/act/17/10){:target="_blank"}) would of course have read Genesis attentively and noticed these things, if they weren't already common knowledge in Judaism of the time (as they likely also were).

Especially with Jesus' extra focus on Genesis as key.


### Limited Personal Honor

Before I continue in my draft notes with the second section alluded to above, a key quote from JPH:

\|We may first note that there were social reasons why Jesus had to be circumspect in His proclamations of divinity:

a need for Jesus to avoid the loaded term "Messiah" which might be assumed to be military; the social constraint of Jewish apocryphal texts, including the Psalms of Solomon and 4 Ezra, which said that only God could declare who the Messiah was.

By this line of thinking, as Charlesworth puts it, "Any self-designation only proves that the proclaimer cannot be the Messiah." Thus, <b>Jesus' relative silence on the issue "may well be an implicit indication that he thought of himself as the Messiah</b>." (ibid.) We have also noted that the Messianic secret theory misses the point that despite these admonitions to silence, Jesus' subjects did go out and tell the story anyway.

But there was an even more primary social reason for <b>Jesus' hesitation for word to spread of himself and his work</b>. Pilch and Malina explain in the Handbook of Biblical Social Values [59ff] three social paradigms that come into play:

Envy -- the begrudging of possession of some quality or object by another.

Limited Good -- the ancient perception that all good things are limited and finite in quantity, including intangibles, like:

Honor -- the accord given by a person to others, a value in the ancient world that they took as seriously as we today take paying the bills.

Taken together, these factors tell us that Jesus' reticence is an example of what would have been regarded as honorable behavior in the ancient world. <b>For Jesus to have been plain about his divinity and Messianic nature in public would have aroused serious envy (as we do see it did, from his opponents, <i>especially in John</i>)</b> as he would have been claiming a high level of honor, and this would have been seen as drawing from the well of honor, which was a "limited good". Thus to make such claims would have been seen as taking honor from others.

The society of Wrede's day was one of limitless good, and without such heavy concentration on honor; hence it is little wonder Wrede came up with the explanation of a "Messianic secret". In an individualist society with limitless good, the thing to do is go out and share what you have with others, and even brag about it. The world Jesus lived in would have found such behavior intolerable -- as did his opponents, and as did the residents of Nazareth.

One more point needs to be noted: Why is it that Jesus often stopped demons from speaking of him? This has been appealed to as part of the Messianic secret theme, but in fact it is not, and the reason for it is different than the above. Malina and Rohrbaugh (Social Science commentary, 183) note that the demons were seeking to protect themselves by "magically using" the "true identity" of Jesus. A desperate move, yes, but deserving of a rebuke, and not an element of Messianic secrecy.\|

Presumably I don't have to spell out the relevance here to who wrote the gospel of John.

Now continuing in my prep notes:


### Trinity

Second, I think the apostle John, Mark, and other early Christians likely noticed that Christ modeled what I've been calling "authorial avoidance" as an optional way to approach self-referential statements by an author in his own work -- by avoiding using his own name in Genesis 1-2:3.

I'm not sure if I got that term from others or if there is a standard term for it, but this was a way authors could avoid seeming to claim too much *personal* honor, as in their culture they believed in a "limited honor" model, that honor (acclaim, likeliness of resources being directed your way, etc.) was a finite resource that had to be allocated.

To be constantly reminding the reader that you were the person often in important events would seem to beat others over the head with how important you are, and that wasn't very appreciated.

This is part of why it's clear right in Genesis 1-2 that "the LORD God" has a *personal* distinction from the one called simply "God" earlier, even though it's also clear the two terms can be used interchangeably or at least cooperatively (compare [1:27](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/1/27/s_1047020){:target="_blank"} & [2:7](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/2/7/s_1047020){:target="_blank"}).
  
This is important as it answers Unitarian-style objections that the pluripersonality of God's internal nature yet singularity of his outward identity is a late invention.
  
It's known that Jews in the Inter-Testamental (IT) period did at least think there might be "Two Powers" in heaven (conflating Son and Spirit to get two instead of three), identified as internal numbering, within God's nature, while God is one entity; these aren't separate beings, but have their own personalities or centers of consciousness.
  
So "God is one" in the Shema ([Deuteronomy 6:4](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/deu/6/4){:target="_blank"}, and related passages [Exodus 20:3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/exo/20/3){:target="_blank"}, [Isaiah 43:10](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/isa/43/10){:target="_blank"}, cf. [Mark 12:29](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mar/12/29){:target="_blank"}), meaning there are no other legitimate gods, yet internally some of his traits can be literally personified, without beginning.
  
Specifically his wisdom (knowledge in action) and ideas which can be expressed as his word(s) for the Son (e.g. [Mark 1:1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mar/1/1){:target="_blank"}, [Matthew 3:17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mat/3/17){:target="_blank"}, [Matthew 8:20](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mat/8/20){:target="_blank"}) / Word ([John 1:1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/1/1){:target="_blank"}, [14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/1/14){:target="_blank"}) / Wisdom (e.g. [Luke 11:49](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/luke/11/49){:target="_blank"}, cf. [Matthew 23:34](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mat/23/34){:target="_blank"}; [Proverbs 8:12](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/pro/8/12){:target="_blank"}, [22-30](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/pro/8/22){:target="_blank"}, [Proverbs 2:6](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/pro/2/6){:target="_blank"}, [Matthew 11:16-19](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mat/11/16){:target="_blank"} / [Luke 7:31-32](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/luk/7/32){:target="_blank"}, cf. [Proverbs 1:24-28](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/pro/1/24){:target="_blank"}) with focus on omnipotence (focus, not sole ability) (e.g. /word of his power/ in [Hebrews 1:3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/heb/1/3){:target="_blank"}), and his action capability (hand; [Ezekiel 1:3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/eze/1/3){:target="_blank"}, [Deuteronomy 2:15](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/deu/2/15){:target="_blank"}, [1st Samuel 12:15](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/1sa/12/15){:target="_blank"}; cf. [Judges 3:10](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jdg/3/10){:target="_blank"}, [Isaiah 61:1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/isa/61/1){:target="_blank"}, [1st Peter 1:2](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/1pe/1/2){:target="_blank"}; finger [Luke 11:20](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/luk/11/20){:target="_blank"}, cf. [Matthew 12:28](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mat/12/28){:target="_blank"}) and thoughts ([John 16:13](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/16/13){:target="_blank"}) / emotions ([Romans 8:26](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/rom/8/26){:target="_blank"}) / understanding ([1st Corinthians 2:10-14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/1co/2/10){:target="_blank"}, [14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/1co/2/14){:target="_blank"}) for the Spirit with focus on omnipresence (esp. in indwelling Christians (multiple people at once); e.g. [Acts 2:4](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/act/2/4){:target="_blank"}, [Romans 8:9](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/rom/8/9){:target="_blank"}; also [Psalm 139:7-8](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/psa/139/7){:target="_blank"}), while the Father focuses on omniscience/knowledge ([Exodus 31:3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/exo/31/3){:target="_blank"}, [1st Peter 1:2](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/1pe/1/2){:target="_blank"}, [Matthew 24:36](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mat/24/36){:target="_blank"}, [Mark 13:32](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mar/13/32){:target="_blank"}) and ultimate authority ([John 8:28](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/8/28){:target="_blank"} / [5:19](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/5/19){:target="_blank"} / [16:13](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/16/13){:target="_blank"}) and as eternally, beginninglessly the source of the other two ([Hebrews 1:3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/heb/1/3){:target="_blank"} (read in context of [2](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/heb/1/2){:target="_blank"} and [5](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/heb/1/5){:target="_blank"}) / [John 8:42](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/8/42){:target="_blank"} / [Colossians 1:15-17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/col/1/15){:target="_blank"}, [John 15:26](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/15/26){:target="_blank"} / [Hebrews 9:14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/heb/9/14){:target="_blank"}).

Also the Spirit is mentioned within the account, as if prepared for action, but then not mentioned again, and all Scripture is inspired by the Spirit (the word for Spirit is also the word for wind or breath, so this is implied in [2nd Timothy 3:16](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/2ti/3/16/s_1128016){:target="_blank"}; see also [2nd Peter 1:21](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/2pe/1/21/s_1157021){:target="_blank"}, [Mark 12:36](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mar/12/36/s_969036){:target="_blank"}), so he has an implied authorial role too.
  
He isn't the one signing the account, so he doesn't need to completely avoid being named in it, yet has a partial avoidance in avoiding clear mentions of what he did (he and the Son both acted in creating; carrying out the "let us" orders from the one called simply God, the Father).

Thus, the Spirit has personal distinctions both from the one called simply "God" and from "the LORD God" (LSB Yahweh God).

In this I see evidence that the "three Persons in one Being" belief of Trinitarianism is actually evidenced right in Genesis, and clearly noticed by the author of the gospel of John in John 1.

Note that there would be no reason to avoid this personal reference if the author was the Father, as it's proper to attribute ultimate honor to him.

Most later authors of portions of Scripture, including the other "toledoth sections," just referred to themselves in the third person, only rarely clarifying in-text that they're the ones authoring it.

This seems to be the other way they avoid seeming to claim too much personal honor, probably motivated based on the need to use the toledoth lines as signatures for what were likely originally oral accounts, later likely written in tablets and on skins (clay tablets are common to the Ancient Near East, typically with the signature lines at the end (colophons), and Jewish extrabiblical sources say that Moses wrote on animal skins; this may have been an early Egyptian tradition, which I think Abraham also adopted, as he visited Egypt and the section I think was authored by him is the first very long one), and eventually papyrus.

Note: I'm saying these individuals likely "authored" sections of Genesis, not "wrote" per se.

Writing, or at least drawing symbols as memory aids, may have developed sooner than is popularly thought, possibly present from the start with Adam, maybe even part of the built-in language knowledge Adam was created with, or taught by the pre-incarnate Christ to Adam along with telling Adam His account of the parts of creation Adam hadn't yet been there to witness, and His perspective of the ones he had.

Although the evidence for development of alphabetic writing specifically post-Babel is strong. Tim Mahoney of Patterns of Evidence even suggests it was a Hebrew innovation. Or they may have helped to popularize it more than others.

Even if the pre-Babel or pre-Flood authors of toledoth sections had no form of writing or mnemonic drawings yet, keep in mind that genetic degradation increases over time, not the other way around, and even today some have photographic memories. This likely would have been universal and later still near-universal, plus generations often overlapped more to hear it from the author directly.

Adam's life for example overlapped everyone in Noah's lineage except Noah himself, in the Masoretic Text (MT) version of the genealogies which our modern Bibles use, and from my study is most likely correct over and against the Septuagint (LXX) or Samaritan Pentateuch (SP).


### Jenga

It probably doesn't seem like pulling out the block of John as author of John and as the disciple Jesus loved risks toppling any important towers, but as should be obvious by now, that's quite far from the case.

Continuing from my prep notes on this:

We can support the Trinity in many other ways, including most of this, but the premise of John as authorially-avoiding with the "disciple loved" phrasing in his gospel is part of the support.

Without this premise, a Unitarian can make it look more plausible that the Trinity is "out of the blue" when (most of) its clearest passages come in the New Testament, or, as many Unitarians do, they could argue that these passages themselves can't mean what they seem to mean to Trinitarians.

Or a biblioskeptic could even argue that the clear Trinitarian teaching in the NT is inconsistent with the OT's supposed lack of clarity on it.

We often answer that God can reveal more about his nature over time, which is true, but to be fair, it would indeed seem weird that such a basic that's so important to his nature wouldn't be taught right away.

If I'm right about John, then it was, and John noticed.

If we take out the John premise, we have less strong evidence for authorial avoidance as specific to Christ, so it becomes more of a stretch to use this to explain why the term "the LORD God" isn't used until 2:4, and the counter can seem more plausible that it's simply that 2:4 goes with what follows and this is just the new synonym for "God," or even to argue for the (generally otherwise debunked but still promoted stubbornly) populist skeptic Documentary Hypothesis / JEDP.

We could still argue for "the LORD God" as the author of 1-2:3, and 2:4 as a signature line based on all the clear evidence from Genesis, but it becomes unclear that the reason for the lack of that term earlier is about personal honor or authorial avoidance.

This is much clearer if John used authorial avoidance -- the same author who started his gospel with "In the beginning was the Word" and adds that he was the primary focus of creative power -- which might otherwise seem like surprising new revelation. Which is possible, but then the apparent total lack of early surprise or dispute of this teaching is, well, surprising.

It makes much more sense if John was seeing this as taught in Genesis following Hebrew rules of interpretation in combination with Christ. Jesus may also have directly told him how this works, so that John would preserve very clear clues to it in his gospel.

We can still argue for the "us-texts" in Genesis as teaching plurality of internal nature of God in some way, and Unitarian arguments against this evidence have indeed been soundly debunked.

Mainly they argue it refers to angels, which the wording forbids as the "us" does the creating, and we're explicitly told God does the creating, not angels. Or some will argue for the "royal we" (plural of majesty) which Hebrew scholars reject as nonexistent for verbs and pronouns, so can't be used for "us," and that argument would prove too much, as it would imply only a plurality is actually majestic.

And one (Sean Finnegan) argues based on the rarity of these "us" wordings (only three indisputable, all in Genesis, arguably a fourth in Isaiah) compared to unipersonal pronouns, which is irrelevant since most of these are referring to the Son or to the Father or to the Spirit rather than the Being, and some even backfire on the Unitarian (e.g. the Father calling the Son "you" in Psalm 110 ([1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/psa/110/1){:target="_blank"} and most of the other verses "your", [4](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/psa/110/4){:target="_blank"} "you").

The Unitarian argument assumes that all such pronouns are literally *personal* pronouns, and that there is no such thing as a pronoun referring to the Being, which I don't assume, but if it's correct, it also means the "you" here has the Father referring to the Messiah as a distinct Person from the Father, and we know from many other OT passages that the Messiah would be God; see [Isaiah 9:6-7](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/isa/9/7){:target="_blank"}, [Psalm 45:6-7](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/psa/45/6){:target="_blank"}, [Micah 5:2](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mic/5/2){:target="_blank"}, [Daniel 7:13-14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/dan/7/13){:target="_blank"},[27](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/dan/7/27){:target="_blank"}).

And the three initial us-texts ([Gen 1:26](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/1/26){:target="_blank"}, [3:22](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/3/22){:target="_blank"}, [11:7](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/11/7){:target="_blank"}) serve as prior context clarifying all later phrasing, so it didn't need to be spelled out explicitly over and over, which is foreign to their high-context culture.

But if in fact the details of the opening, avoided self-referential naming, and authorship of John (the gospel) mean what I think they mean, then the Trinity specifically (as three actually listed Persons, not just a vague plurality with unspecified number or sense) was taught using the rules of Hebrew right to Adam, and was always understood by all later authors and readers as foundational.
