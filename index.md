# BibleSeek - Bible Truthseeking

## Recent topics:

- [Exodus Logistics](ExodLogistics). Convo/notes save. Initial findings after some arguments claiming it definitely didn't work. This is specific to the 2 years after leaving Egypt and the 40 years wandering.
- UPDATE: Must-read notes have been updated a bit about square brackets in LSB quotations; read it even if you have read the old version before as of 2024 06 10. (You can find the must-read-notes at any of the normal topic links below; this is a page content section that is maintained as a separate file and displayed before the table of contents for all of my normal template pages. You can also see it in the template links themselves at this index page's footer.)
- [Verifying Jesus' Resurrection Post-Ascension (Then and Now)](VerifyChristResPostAscension). Convo save with a standard answer phrased well enough this time to article-ify.
- [Jairus' Daughter Death-Timing Contradiction Claim](JairusDaughtContra). A convo save notes going through Matthew, Mark, and Luke on this, finding: no contradiction. [Complete for now, other than format issues.]
- [Bible is Anti-Slavery](BibleIsAntiSlavery). This isn't an ideal, well-organized, direct analysis of all the Bible says relevant to popular biblioskeptic absurdities claiming it's pro-slavery, but in the course of answering a series of quotes of a skeptic I was asked to review I cover a lot of what I had found in many past times of researching aspects of it. This is a save of my response, originally written in Notepad but became too long to post directly where it was asked.
- [Flatteners Fail to Flatten the Bible's Earth or Sky](FlattenerFail). Arguments examined from those who want to make the Bible seem to teach a Flat Earth, whether biblioskeptics or professing Christians. [VERY UNFINISHED WIP]
- [Did Lazarus Write John? Is he the Disciple Jesus Loved?](DidLazarusWriteJohn_ShortAnswer) Why I think answer's no to both. [[Long Answer](DidLazarusWriteJohn) draft form complete (typo list collected, not yet fixed), short answer version is work in progress (WIP)].
- [Lingua](Lingua) & [Cipher](Cipher) (some language systems, Lingua is the main one useful here, for pronunciation guides). WIP.
## Foundational topics:

WIPs; unmade or drafted but unposted:
- [Seek: How to Read the Bible According to the Bible](HowToRead)

- [Seek: Biblical Definition of God](BibleDefinesGod)
- [Proof: Yahweh God & Bible](ProofOfYahweh)
- [Looks Don't Deceive You - You Do](LooksDontDeceive) - They claimed it looks false, a claim which is false, but then they did say, believe anyway.

## More key topics
- [Genesis Toledoth (Generation / Account) Lines](ToledothTheory) - What I think verses like Genesis 2:4, 5:1, etc. mean, key relevances, weighing opposition reasoning. See also its [Seek]() page.
