# Seek: How to Read the Bible According to the Bible

**Bible Question:** What does the Bible itself say about how it should be read? What patterns does it use? What are the rules of the source "language culture" in context?

This is obviously a vast subject, and we can't cover everything, and it's something we all are continually learning more about. Keep in mind the cautions in template sections on this page, I'm not an expert. Experts undoubtedly have many observations I'm not yet aware of, and some of those might render some of my thoughts on this incorrect.

So take everything as tentative but with an observation that as far as I've found so far, following the Bible's own rules, as far as we can attempt to discern the statements (which is an iterative process involving all past translations and translators of the languages involved, of course, to even get us to a point that APPEARS to be understandable) -- that the body of interpretations that logically follow from these rules "just happen" to naturally fit best with all other observations when carefully determined by sound logic.

This is highly unlikely by chance, which gives both a high degree of justified confidence in the truth of the Bible AND of the accuracy of the methods of understanding it.

My approach here began with a whole-Bible study, manually, in the late pre-internet years in my youth, line by line asking myself if any verse I'm reading APPEARS to be relevant possibly to interpretation, and taking note of them, briefly writing down ideas about what might be the implications, without assuming anything.

I'm now calling this kind of study a "seek" study for sake of having a way to say this very concisely in article titles for this site.

At the time that was all just in paper notes.

Then (after much other study, and other "seek" studies as well as other whole-Bible readthroughs in general), as more options became available with the internet, slowly learning all I could from others (unfortunately no formal study options were available to me). Adding the benefit that others, including scholars of course, might have observations I wouldn't have noticed, especially from those who study the source culture, the languages, etc.

As well as adding the options now of word searches (though it's a mistake to rely on these as your FIRST approach for a careful understanding, although often these are all we have time for), and many other tools, especially the tools at BLB.

And now again starting from the start in LSB, though usually recording here in WEBP since "seek" studies may quote vast numbers of verses.
