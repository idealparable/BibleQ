# How to Read the Bible According to the Bible

**Bible Study Topic:** What does the Bible itself say about how it should be read? What patterns does it use? What are the rules of the source "language culture" in context (how structures of thought work, expressed in any language to some extent, such as parallelism)?

This is obviously a vast subject; I can't cover everything, and it's something we're all continually learning more about. Keep in mind I'm not an expert. Experts undoubtedly have many observations I'm not yet aware of, and some of those might render some of my thoughts on this incorrect.

So take everything as tentative but with an observation that as far as I've found so far, following the Bible's own rules, as far as we can attempt to discern the statements (which is an iterative process involving all past translations and translators of the languages involved, of course, to even get us to a point that APPEARS to be understandable) -- that the body of interpretations that logically follow from these rules "just happen" to naturally fit best with all other observations when carefully determined by sound logic.

This is highly unlikely by chance, which gives both a high degree of justified confidence in the truth of the Bible AND of the accuracy of the methods of understanding it.

My approach here began with a whole-Bible study, manually, in the late pre-internet years in my youth, line by line asking myself if any verse I'm reading APPEARS to be relevant possibly to interpretation, and taking note of them, briefly writing down ideas about what might be the implications, without assuming anything.

I'm now calling this kind of study a "seek" study for sake of having a way to say this very concisely in article titles for this site.

At the time that was all just in paper notes.

Then (after much other study, and other "seek" studies as well as other whole-Bible readthroughs in general), as more options became available with the internet, slowly learning all I could from others (unfortunately no formal study options were available to me). Adding the benefit that others, including scholars of course, might have observations I wouldn't have noticed, especially from those who study the source culture, the languages, etc.

As well as adding the options now of word searches (though it's a mistake to rely on these as your FIRST approach for a careful understanding, although often these are all we have time for), and many other tools, especially the tools at BLB.

And now again starting from the start in LSB, because it gives more tools directly in the English text than others, with generally less problems than others, though usually recording here in WEBP since "seek" studies may quote vast numbers of verses. I recommend reading the LSB in splitscreen or on another device or paper as you read along as that will reflect what I'm looking at.

My original studies, I forget how early I switched to ESV, but my earliest Bible was an NIV, so it would have been in one of those, probably NIV. NIV is an attempted thought for thought translation and as such takes a lot of liberties. The preface to ESV contrasts its approach with thought-for-thought, but does say only that major words are ensured to be represented, while other structure around them may be altered, so in effect it is still a partial thought for thought approach.

LSB is much more strictly an attempted word for word. It can be good to familiarize yourself with thought-for-though translations to get a sense of how the grammar (is thought to) translate to English grammar, but it's best to understand the actual word order too and get a sense of the source language grammar through a source like LSB.

This study will necessarily have to put off some studies still relevant to interpretation, such as a seek study on use of "all" language I would like to do (see [here](DidLazarusWriteJohn#non-literall){:target="_blank"}; this was a pattern I didn't know about on my own and learned from scholarship findings collated by JPH and others), or the planned article about Proverbs. And likely countless other patterns. Some basics on those I may try to include, though.

Despite these attempts to reduce how much will be in here, this might end up being the longest page on this site ever, quite possibly, or I might end up splitting it across multiple pages, we'll see.

My original study focused more on the NT, especially gospels and epistles more so than Acts or Revelation, then looking through OT secondarily. This time I'll be starting from Genesis.

Later I might try to make summary-of-"findings" articles based on all of this, besides the Genesis authorship one already planned.

This page may be updated at any time.

Navigation note: The Table of Contents (TOC) above has the Bible books list links to each book section below. Then each section has links to the sections for the chapters in that book. The ends of each section have links back to the TOC.

This page uses a template structure I can duplicate for other "Seek" whole-Bible studies. For that reason and so that I can always easily add observations later, the entire structure is here for all chapters in the Bible.

So as you scroll down you'll likely see long stretches with nothing but blank sections. Keep scrolling; don't assume it's all blank.

Or you can use a Find search if your browser has it (unsure if all options on touchscreen operating systems do, like those on phones) and look for each next "/" (slash), since every observation will come with a Bible quote and I use those to delimit them.

##### 1(Genesis).1:1 God, Uncreated, Creates Time & Everything Else

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/1 In the beginning, God† created the heavens and the earth./</span></blockquote>

It's said that Hebrew grammarians say that the word for "beginning" here means an absolute beginning, so no room for beliefs in pre-existent matter. This is the beginning of (single-linear, single-directional) time and only God exists before it.

This would be a good example of where reading beyond the Bible, albeit cautiously, would be wise in case others' perspectives can help understand the source language more correctly than an English translation would suggest.

It's also said that the phrase "the heavens and the earth" is a merism, a type of synecdoche (read on), a phrase functioning much the same way as a word would, for the Hebrews' way to say "all creation" (literally everything created, anywhere, ever).

A synecdoche, in case you don't know what that is (I had no idea for either of these terms when I first heard them on the topic, suggesting others might not know either), is an example from within a set, used as a term for the set.

Synecdoches can be more memorable than trying to invent technical names for categories, and they are (thought to be) used often in the Bible.

It's pronounced, by the way, in what I call the Standard American English accent (StAE), often called General American, as sih-NEHK-d(uh)-Kee (using my Lingua (Ln) transliteration system; see [here](Lingua)).

A merism uses two synecdoches, in this case the two opposite ends of a possible spectrum, from the nearest to the furthest.

They use contrasting or complementing pairs to express a whole, including everything between them not stated.

Earth doesn't mean the planet; it means soil primarily and things closely related to it like bedrock (and we still have meanings like that today for the English word earth, not just the name of the planet, such as in earthenware), but not the seas or the atmosphere.

It's defined a little later in this first chapter as dry land, in all later cases.

Here it probably means the materials that would soon be shaped into dry land (whether still water that was transmuted into other materials, a common view, or already the materials not shaped yet until Day 3).

Note that it's been said that our world was not yet named Earth (or equivalent terms in the directly relevant cultures to the Bible or to modern English) until after the Bible was written.

It was named that, though, likely for similar reasons that the word is used here; humans are land-dwelling beings, so to us, the nearest home is the land, not the seas (not most naturally at least), or the air, or outer space or anything beyond the nearest regions of that.

So here we see evidence that (unsurprisingly), we have a focus on human perspective.

However, I see this (and many other considerations, some of which I'll be covering soon) as evidence that this is likely an account written by the Pre-Incarnate Christ, likely with a manifestation present in some form as soon as he had created timespace to manifest within.

This implies the time here is the time perspective on Earth, and Jesus was directly observing everything.

This would put some perspective for us (if you'll pardon re-using the word so soon), on things like Jesus walking on water. Since in his omniscience, he foreknows what humans will be created like, he might have already manifested as one here. We see that he does when he visits Abraham shortly before the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, so the Incarnation was not the first time. In the Garden of Eden he may have as well. Or he may be in the "Angel of the Lord" form.

So although he isn't named, it seems likely implied already that he's here, though part of why I suspect so is due to later evidence.

I think the account from 1:1 to 2:3, at least, is authored most likely by Jesus directly, and likely was told early on to Adam, who either memorized it and passed it on verbally, adding his own perspective for his own orally "authored" account later, or written if there was in fact some early form of writing already. (Or a mix of both, if there might have been mnemonic symbols that would later be developed into early pictographs, perhaps.) And I think 2:4 is the signature line saying this.

Another aspect of this I think is key for interpretation purposes at least in Genesis 1 is that this shows the perspective is written so that human hearers/readers would understand, in defining "earth" as the nearest, and "heavens" as the furthest (which could include places beyond our 3 dimensions of space and 1 of time, perhaps; everything "out there" beyond our focus on earth -- on land.)

This tells us several things.

First, the temporal perspective will probably be ours. More context shown shortly will confirm that (within the rules of the language culture -- note that all known testable arguments against this are debunked; see for example CMI and AiG; see [end notes](#end-notes) about them).

Second, humans in early history, understandably, saw the surface of land as the place from which they look out at everything else.

This implies in turn a third observation, that the seas and the atmosphere have something in common, their "out-there"-ness, to the earliest humans.

It's thought that this persisted throughout ancient times, with it being said that even in the time of Jesus, there was a fear of the sea, even for those whose livelihoods involved boats on it such as fishermen, explaining the terror they often felt during sea storms. Yet Jesus could sleep calmly during such a storm.

This makes sense, as land doesn't (normally) rock, and if it does, it can be deadly if structures or large tree branches collapse on you. The sensation of high waves rocking a boat during a downpour could be unsettling, plus the human understanding of how they could be dashed against rocks they couldn't see right while steering might be difficult, perhaps rocks too far from actual survivable land to reach it alive.

Of course, I'm describing a post-Fall perspective, but God of course foreknew that would happen, and in any case, the sense of land as the most "here" to humans makes sense.

This suggests that the air is seen in a way comparable to the waters, and indeed, the Hebrew word for the heavens, shamayim (Ln shah-MAI-yeem), is said to be a combination of, or meant to resemble, the word for fire and (it does include the same letters as) the word for water.

At the very least, the word for water, seen shortly, is indeed mayim (Ln MAI-yeem; literally waters; -im (Ln eem) is the masculine plural suffix).

The word for fire is esh (Ln EHSH), not exactly the same although it could be transformed into it since the consonant is the same and Hebrew is (or originally was) a consonantal language, and the actual etymology of shamayim may be something else instead.

In any case, the waters term resemblance MIGHT help suggest already even as early as this verse that waters are not part of "earth" so that that term isn't talking about world-Earth. Though, here it probably is talking about all the materials of world-Earth other than air and water.

It also suggests that there is no implication that we are in the exact center of the universe per se, yet it's also possible we were originally and that motions of our sun and our galaxy over time might have moved us slightly away from that, if in fact the universe does have an edge and therefore center.

It also might suggest that the heavier materials that are under our feet are the center of our planet, rather than land floating atop water.

This would also be easy for people to verify; simply wade into any stream and you can see that earthen materials are heavier than water.

This all repudiates Flat-Earth models and geocentric ones. The center in view here is where humans are, but not directly the center of the earth, and yet the "earth" (not world-Earth with a capital E) has nothing underneath it, and all the stars all around (if "heavens" includes them, and much later context implies it does) are "up" and "out there" in all directions, thus the gravitational center has to be a point inside a sphere (as we can observe by shape and turning across each night, and year, that the sky appears as a sphere, not a flat surface above or even a literal dome).

It hasn't yet provided insight on solid-sky models (some do have Earth as a sphere with a spherical solid sky around it), though it might also suggest against them, since they would indeed put the center more obviously down below us rather than any place where a human is on our world-Earth's lands being the "here-center" in this perspective.

Beyond all of that (literally), this passage also tells us that God is beyond even linear time, as this is the absolute beginning of everything created ever, and yet God has no origin; he simply is.

In line with my findings in my proof of God as the single fully-infinite pattern of existence of all infinities in that one single pattern, with no limits at all, this God is necessary to exist, in a way that is naturally intuitive. I'll be explaining that in articles eventually, God willing, on this site.

This verse is written in a way that appeals to that soundly-proven intuition, and as such it passes all tests that could be applied for a most foundational verse as that of a genuine message from the most ultimate divine being who can possibly exist.

This is unlikely by chance, to put it mildly.

And beyond apologetics purposes, many of these factors will help us interpret the rest of the Bible properly, including the rest of Genesis 1. Many of them are among the most crucial interpretive clues. And that those are so skillfully in the first verse is also, in turn, more apologetic evidence.

Many today wrongly think that for an apologetic to be logical, it needs to accommodate an old Earth. As mentioned, this was also debunked. It's thought that this merism may be doing double duty as well, not simply stating the absolute beginning but also summarizing the whole creation week.

If so this would rule out at least the so-called gap "theory" (which is quite the opposite of a theory; it's wild speculation). There is no room for a gap between a summary of the whole creation week and its start.

As such, much of the debate about how the next verse starts and how it's grammatically related to this one is evidently not really relevant. That said, I've seen it shown that it does only support the "young" Earth (YE) interpretation.

Since so much in science has now confirmed a YE, though currently few have been allowed to be taught this or have bothered to check correctly, for the informed on the subject this also serves apologetic value, while also cluing us in that the text does not contradict what we've confirmed through (real) science.

##### 1(Genesis).1:2-3 Dark Hovering Parallelism

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/2 The earth was formless and empty. Darkness was on the surface of the deep and God’s Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters.
3 God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light./</span></blockquote>

Formless and empty (tohu and bohu; Ln TOH-hue and BOH-hue (hue in Ln is pronounced like who, not like the English word hue pronounced HYUE)) is much-debated.

Given that the dry land isn't shaped (or transmuted and shaped?) yet until Day 3, though, phrasing like this would make sense. It implies at least that mass that would become the dry land already exists.

But translations like "waste" that make it sound like the result of a past disaster are unwarranted (if at the time the term "waste" implied that, but shouldn't be taken in such a way in any case). This has also contributed to some acceptance of views almost certainly incorrect, like (yet again) gap "theory".

Note that the "earth" here clearly can't include the waters, since they would have shape (gravitationally, that of a sphere).

Whether that sphere encompassed the mass of the entire universe in some way, as Dr. Russel Humphreys consideres as a possibility, I don't see clearly answered here. It would be possible, but hints that Jesus may be walking on it might suggest against it, though the intense gravity of that would  hardly be a problem for him anymore than walking on water itself would.

The word here translated "on" in WEBP or "over" in many others like LSB (al, Ln AHL, sounding like the English word "all") was the focus of a word study I did at one point, looking through the example uses.

Many of the early-Genesis uses seem to have a meaning that usually fits the perspective of an observer being closer than a surface or apparent surface that the thing in question is over or on or in front of or under, depending on where the observer and that surface are. The thing in question is consistently not on the other side of a surface hidden behind it from an observer's POV.

Usually, the thing in question is between the observer and the surface.

In some cases, as with birds on land, the thing in question is above the surface and may go higher than the observer so that the observer would be between the thing in question and the surface, but can also be relatively between when the birds are landed.

This would suggest the observer here, if any, may be standing on the water or perhaps also hovering over it, and the Spirit and the darkness may extend above the observer. So this would also be compatible with an implied Pre-Incarnate Christ.

I have noted before that there is a parallelism here that sets up darkness and the Spirit in question. As said previously:

<blockquote>|What was over the water? It's unclear if there was air yet; that may be what was primarily added on Day 2, but in any case, we do know two things above the water, as the parallelism shows:

||darkness|was|on|the surface of|the deep|
|(and)|God's Spirit|was|hovering over|the surface of|the waters|

In other words, the Spirit was dark -- not shining, not making light yet.

This in turn means that the Spirit of God / God's Spirit, the Holy Spirit was the source of light in the next few verses!|</blockquote>

Keep in mind that the format in Hebrew is confirmed abundantly to be that of the historical narration genre. Structures like this might be mistaken for a justification for calling Genesis 1 poetry. This is a misunderstanding of how genre classification, and more fundamentally, the language culture in general, worked.

Structures could be used in poetry and in prose, without any implication of figurative language being implied. The association between the two is a modern psychological case of circular reasoning and anachronism.

Since our language culture generally doesn't use parallelism at all, and since we see it being used as the primary defining feature of Hebrew poetry such as the Psalms that survives the translation, and especially since not all parallelisms are formatted by our English translators like the Psalms (though we will see one shortly that traditionally is), we may think that in finding parallelism here about the deep and waters that we've found a missed proof that this is poetry.

But that would be self-refuting, since the structure isn't used in virtually any of the rest of this section.

Likewise for the merism we talked about earlier. The second aspect we anachronize is thinking that if we DO find a case of figurative language, it implies the whole thing is poetry.

Again, that's not how it worked, and we apply this rule inconsistently (Jesus might use a stronger word here starting with an h and ending with ypocritically) when we see, so often, news reporters using (generally bad) puns and figures of speech to try (in vain) to spice up their reporting, yet we would never dream of dismissing the things they report as mere allegory or the like.

The later case of parallelism that does seem to be poetry, and as such is typically translated in the traditional format English translators use for Hebrew poetry, looks like a mnemonic device used to emphasize, and thus show God's central care for, humans, about our being made in God's image.

These are sometimes used freely for such things, interspersed inside what otherwise is prose. They don't imply the prose isn't prose.

In this case, the parallelism isn't being used like that; it's part of the prose structure, and its purpose seems to be more about phrasing things in a compact informative way and making it more interesting, telling us what the light source is (that is, who the light source is), without turning it into a longer dry lecture filled with technical clarifications.

Note also that the phrasing for how the light came to be is the same as many others for things nobody questions are created by God throughout the rest of this chapter.

It's weird that we (at least we moderns) have this idea that the light would be an exception, speculating some other temporary created light source that is unnecessary and less parsimonious. And it would probably be less efficient design, unless of course, Jesus himself had his incarnation function that way, but it seems to say instead that the Spirit produced the light most directly, in context of other considerations about the Trinity I will discuss and have discussed in more detail elsewhere; in short, the one called simply God (the Father), gives the orders, the Word/Son/Wisdom manifests the message and may be speaking them out loud in some way, and the Spirit does the actions that produce the results).

All of those ideas, while not completely disproven, seem to commit the special pleading fallacy.

This could otherwise be potential evidence that Jesus was in an angelic form rather than a human form, since those are often portrayed as shining. But in the transfiguration, Jesus' human form appeared to shine as well, without needing to turn into some other angelic form (also perhaps angelic forms do look just like human forms or can, so this may be a moot question).

Being in human form would probably help highlight better the "created in God's image" phrasing later, though note it's thought this has nothing to do literally with our shape. This would just be predicting our shape and manifesting in it to emphasize that the Son helps us relate to God. Our form itself would be designed to be the ideal adaptable form for a land-dwelling sapient being.

Here we also see that the Spirit is mentioned at first, showing less authorial avoidance, then after that isn't mentioned again, implying he had some role in the authoring of the account, and implying what was known to early Christianity that the Spirit inspired all Scripture. This shows a personal distinction from the Son, and implies he played a role in creating.

The passive voice in "there was light" also implies authorial avoidance, and involvement of the author, so this implies the author created. (See [here](DidLazarusWriteJohn#limited-personal-honor) for some of the reasoning involved in what I mean about authorial avoidance. More in favor of that is all throughout that article about authorship of John (I mean my article, not JPH's) and its [short version](DidLazarusWriteJohn_ShortAnswer).)

Once again, we have a lot of groundwork observations themselves, and all of these help us understand how to correctly interpret what follows.

##### 1(Genesis).1:4-5 See One Day

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/4 God saw the light, and saw that it was good. God divided the light from the darkness. 5 God called the light “day”, and the darkness he called “night”. There was evening and there was morning, the first day./</span></blockquote>

It's been proven beyond reasonable doubt that the phrasing in verse 5 defines this as a single roughly 24-hour day. This isn't just about the use of the word for day (yom; Ln YOHM), as many assert without having done the homework on it. When it's used with evening and morning and a number in this way, especially in context of daylight and night, it means a 24-hour day.

What about "saw;" what might that mean? After all, God is omniscient, yes?

However, we see many passages later in the Bible where we're told that God comes to "know" things, while others agree God knows everything. The word for "know" can mean and often does mean experiential knowledge, as it does with the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, not head knowledge. This is seen in cases like the euphemism that Adam "knew" his wife, and a child resulted. It doesn't mean he obtained intellectual knowledge.

So examples about God saying "now I know", as a baseline at least, imply that when something has happened, where in time and space it happens is where God has (doesn't gain anew, but experiences in a present-tense-like timeless way) experiential knowledge of it.

Notice that when God expels Adam and Eve from the Garden, he confirms that he has experiential knowledge of good and evil.

This of course can imply in that case nothing more than that God has "run simulations" (not in a single-linear-time sense but that he has full knowledge like the results of a simulation in his omniscience) and understands exactly what everything would be like causally-prior (not temporally prior) without needing to observe it actually happening.

But in light of later passages, it seems to confirm that he also has direct observational knowledge of all of what happens throughout all of what to us is our future at any given moment. This obviously would also be the case for the ultimate God, and it implies his timelessness includes literally all multi-directional "time," not merely as if a super-smart but temporal entity in the past had simulated everything.

So, language about God seeing things is hardly surprising. Knowing what this God is, we should expect such language up front.

It may also be another hint at a manifestation with eyes at the time.

I've also thought that it seems likely and maybe implied throughout the OT that Jesus had been maintaining a manifestation of one type or another throughout history.

Also, God may have been giving him an experience similar to what it was like in his Incarnate body where his brain in that body had finite space for knowledge "onboard" but he could know anything he needed to, in that body, since he as a divine Person is omniscient, and the Father and Spirit also can share a focus on delivering that knowledge to the manifestation.

This could have been happening all along, so things like Jesus saying he knows not the hour of his return may help explain passages like this, or like God being "grieved" about the violence leading up to the Flood.

In the latter case it's often wrongly claimed to imply God had done something wrong, but the rest of the Bible shows God had a plan for humanity, which is also implied by bothering to save some of them on the ark. The strong wording, though, may imply more than merely an anthropomorphism; Jesus may have been manifested as a living anthropomorphism of God all along, and experiencing emotions in a way similar to a human.

##### 1(Genesis).1:6-8 Expansive Sky

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/6 God said, “Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.” 7 God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so. 8 God called the expanse “sky”. There was evening and there was morning, a second day./</span></blockquote>

The meaning of expanse (as well as waters above) is the subject of a lot of my focus, and my reasoning on it is too involved to try to summarize sufficiently here.

LINK IT HERE LATER WHEN WRITTEN AS AN ARTICLE!

(Note to self ^^)

But in short, the word here translated expanse does quite literally mean expanse; an distance or separation, or a thing which has been expanded.

Here it's clearly a vertical expanse and thus cannot be a solid sky. More evidence for that is seen later and I'll be focusing on some of what gives us interpretive keys that lead directly to that deduction.

Note that those who still try to have it somehow mean a solid sky haven't thought this through very well anyways; they usually don't realize their view would require a solid object be made originally inside the waters, and then pushed up, shapeshifting, into a dome shape, since this says the expanse divided the waters, not that God directly miraculously lifted the waters and then create a solid dome under them.

I think this suggests the waters above are primarily clouds, but there may have been water in some way above all along. We aren't told of the creation of air, so I do tend to think air was made on Day 1, and water may have been mixed as a mist throughout it, and extending higher up to possibly liquid water in the shape of the heavenly bodies to be transmuted later into them physically.

The last point about transmutation, at least, was the premise that Dr. Russel Humphreys (yes, same one mentioned earlier) used to accurately predict the magnetic field of Mercury, based on his reading of a passage in Peter about this. As such it seems likely that it includes all the heavenly bodies already, but perhaps there was already some distance without stuff in it, or maybe water was spread out equally in a mistlike form above the waters of the world-Earth and then gathered into the shapes of the heavenly bodies (all of these are equally easy for God of course, despite the vast distances involved).

Since the expanse itself is later named heaven (heavens) and birds are proven to be in it, and the expanse causes the lifting up of the waters above, I think that most directly the waters above in view here are simply clouds, and this is saying this was beginning to naturally happen on Day 2.

However, it also says that God did the dividing as well.

It's possible this simply means that the expanse's "dividing" is just saying when God moved mist around from a previously scattered arrangement into clouds, then the division appeared between the water, and then God did some other action not stated to turn it into the clouds or they just did on their own then, but the parallelism with a thing in creation doing something and God doing the thing is used many times in the rest of the Bible to mean God did it providentially.

This should be expected for the omniscient, omnipotent creator, via the domino effect.

Keep in mind this doesn't mean he wanted bad things that happen. That's disproven by Romans 9 saying God "endures" evil. I'll have other content about that later about my fuller disproof of the Problem of Evil bad argument, and explaining why God needing to create things how he did including how history happened isn't wanting the evil yet isn't due to weakness or any other explanation; it all simply logically follows from his omniscience, and criticisms are based on failing to think this through.

So basically this could mean, and probably does mean, that God had created the universe the way he did knowing that without even the need for miraculous action in this case, per se, the clouds naturally formed in air.

Creative miracles are more expected during creation, though, so both are options. Also, since it seems God was creating the light, and causing the heat which kept the water liquid, God would also be working a constant miracle at the time that also indirectly caused the clouds by evaporation of water. This process would take some time; it isn't surprising it happened on the second day. In that sense, God was literally causing the clouds AND the air was helping to cause them naturally, as two "ingredient" factors.

Note that a popular old idea, the canopy theory, is debunked.

That idea was based largely on a misreading of a passage in Genesis 2 about rain, turning it into an interpretation that no rain ever happened before the Flood of Noah and that thus there was an entirely different system for watering the land pre-Flood. No mainstream, informed biblical creationist today considers this a viable model, though I heard of one (and as far as I know, only one) who several years ago said he is still trying to find ways to make it viable, but it seems completely unneeded as nothing in the text suggests it.

In fact, in light of the strong evidence for my SAUA theory (Sig After Until Abe), about the toledoths and authorship of sections of Genesis, most likely Adam wrote the verse they thought was denying rain before the Flood, and he died before the Flood, so in fact, that very same verse is CONFIRMING rain before the Flood!

What the verse really means is that on the sixth day of the creation week, it hadn't rained yet. This surely makes sense; it would take time for rainstorms to form. It also mentions a mist from the ground. Since the land had just been created out of water, this also makes sense, and this would naturally dissipate later.

Notice as well that here, unlike most other cases, it's explicitly confirmed that God made the expanse rather than merely the "it was so" although that phrase is included too.

This is telling us what all the other "it was so" passages mean. 

In light of the signs of authorial avoidance, I think that most likely not much domino effect is in play yet, so the combination of factors explanation seems more likely. Large-scale, dramatic miracles, in the fallen era, are usually reserved for credentialing God's Word as it was being authored.

But this is pre-Fall, and we have other language that shows this account is intended to say it takes place over just one week on Earth, in our time. So direct creative action is more likely here, though in the fallen era, many of God's stated actions may be and in some cases have to be domino effect (hardening of Pharoah's heart even as Pharoah hardens his own heart, since God doesn't violate freewill, and most likely cases like the equivalent of the lucky dice roll in Esther probably are as well).

This would also imply that when it says God created, it doesn't mean God gave commands to angels to carry it out, but that God himself did it.

This implies that the authorial avoidance is about someone who is God, yet is also in some sense not the one being often called simply God, and isn't the Spirit of God, who, since he does have some avoidance, is likewise in some sense not the same as the one called simply God.

This strongly implies the Trinity.

We will see this pattern also with creation of humans, and with the account section I think is Adam's in Genesis 2, this will use God creating in parallel with the LORD God / Yahweh God creating humans, and LORD God / Yahweh God is the name in the signature line (2:4) that is right after 1:1-2:3 which has events no human could witness thus is most likely God's perspective (unless it were an angel). Thus, I think the other being implied here is the LORD God (who I think is Jesus), because he's authoring this account and showing humility toward the authority role (functional, not ontological) of the Father.

Finally, we need to pay attention to places where one term is named another term. We have this several times, as here with "sky" (WEBP; LSB heavens).

That definition is important in the proof that the expanse is air later. We see this also next with "earth" being called dry land and the waters below, gathered into one place, called seas.

By the way, Dr. Danny Faulkner argues that the waters above aren't the clouds, since other words for clouds aren't used here. I don't find that argument to be well-grounded, as a whole search of other uses of heavens, expanse, and words for clouds show they can be used interchangeably, and "heavens" can take on the meaning of whatever you can see when you look up so that clouds become "heavens" in the later chapters of Job when they are seeing full cloud cover.

A similar argument could have denied that those were clouds, since there is a word for clouds. But the context shows that clouds can be referred to by other terms. Since clouds literally are water, and since the Hebrew phrasing POV usually has the nearest meanings in mind and you would need more contextual evidence to override the nearest meaning, I think they simply are (or include) clouds.

Also, ancients likely would have understood it to be clouds because their common experience was that rain, which clearly is water, comes from clouds, thus the clouds, they would conclude, at least contain water. Job comments on this, in fact. They had no way to experience pre-Day 4 waters that the heavenly bodies might be made of, so would likely see that kind of meaning as more speculative and "out there". It makes sense to include that meaning prior to Day 4, but not, I think, to limit it solely to that meaning at that time.

##### 1(Genesis).1:9-10 Waters in One Place

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/9 God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear;” and it was so. 10 God called the dry land “earth”, and the gathering together of the waters he called “seas”. God saw that it was good./</span></blockquote>

When trying to reconstruct in your mind what the text is saying, it's important not to miss features.

In my experience that's the most common problem when people are trying to interpret God's Word, and are confused or have multiple interpretations. Yes, many details simply aren't included, but often people will read a passage out loud, be looking at it in front of them, and then discuss trying to figure out what it means while looking at each other only, not at the text, not checking to see if any questions the had might have data in the text that could possibly be intended to answer it.

(And sometimes sinful attitudes go way beyond that as well.)

Here for example, many somehow miss that it says waters are gathered into ONE place.

Oddly I saw one person claim that they sat down one day and sketched, supposedly, exactly what Genesis 1 describes as a cosmology, and claimed the drawing came out, without any bias on his part, to the typical modern claim of a flat land surrounded by a ring of water, and a solid dome over it.

None of those features are in the text!

And features that ARE there don't fit with it. A ring of water AROUND the land is an odd thing to describe as gathered into one place. This fits much better on a globe with an original supercontinent and superocean, both of which are now very well supported scientifically in line with the Flood model of Dr. John Baumgardner.

It's commonly thought by those who are very informed on the matter and affirm the proven spherical world-Earth that the Bible doesn't actually comment on the shape of the world.

I hold to that view by default, at least as in that it doesn't absolutely prove a model of the world-Earth, but here it does seem to strongly hint that it wouldn't fit with any flat world model, unless it had land only in the outer ring and a central ocean, but no flat world model to date has ever suggested that.

They might try to salvage it by saying their supposed "ice wall" is the land-ring in the NEW Flat-Earth model (which puts the north pole as the center of a circle and turns Antarctica into the ice wall all around it, which is as absurd as the older one, if not more so, which at least had real sun"sets" and the like, but they have been forced by frequent modern travel across the Pacific to abandon the old model). But this would obviously be less parsimonious, since the waters wouldn't really be just in one place, and the land people actually live on would be something else not mentioned, plus it says plants grow on this land next.

##### 1(Genesis).1:11-13 Earth Yield

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/11 God said, “Let the earth yield grass, herbs yielding seeds, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with their seeds in it, on the earth;” and it was so. 12 The earth yielded grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with their seeds in it, after their kind; and God saw that it was good. 13 There was evening and there was morning, a third day./</span></blockquote>

In light of the time frame, even saying that the earth yielded the plants, I don't think we can inerpret this as merely the domino effect (no room for evolution here), nor even just the miraculous creation only of seeds and slow growth of most plants.

The latter might seem to be implied in Genesis 2, though, but I think simply means that farm fields had not been laid out by people yet. (Since that would make that statement literally true.)

The same is the case of humans made from earth later. This is talking about miraculous transmutation of earth to plants, and later to humans.

This is probably tied to why God encapsulated the choice of freewill into a tree, an ets in Hebrew, rising up out of the erets (earth), shaped like a branching relationship tree of descent of future humanity from Adam and Eve, signifying (with a physical symbol, not a mere symbol in the text, but a visual symbol in front of a literal Adam and Eves' eyes) the choice of whether to inflict a future of mixed good and evil on their children.

Sadly, they chose to do so, and we suffer the consequences as they did.

Note that covenants throughout Genesis typically came with some kind of physical symbol, such as the alter of Moses or the rainbow, or the countless physical symbols of the Mosaic law. I think God begins setting up an original Adamic covenant with the command not to eat of the forbidden tree, with conditions, much like the Mosaic Law had conditions, and Adam and Eve broke that rule, violating that covenant.

So we would expect a physical symbol to go with this covenant in some way.

When did God make the garden, now, or on Day 6?

Note that it's said that Hebrew past tense can be past perfect (had created) in the Genesis 2 description of this. That account is describing in real time an elaboration on Day 6, that time from Adam's point of view, most of them in past tense. It could be that additional plants were made then and it's simply past tense, though a case about the animals is clearly past-perfect, so I suspect it's past-perfect here as well. Either way is possible and there's nothing to contradict either that I know of.

##### 1(Genesis).1:14-19 Lights in the Expanse

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/14 God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs to mark seasons, days, and years; 15 and let them be for lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth;” and it was so. 16 God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He also made the stars. 17 God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light to the earth, 18 and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. God saw that it was good. 19 There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day./</span></blockquote>

What does "in" mean?

It's biy (pronounced like "bee" in StAE, Standard American English or General American, Ln BIY or BEE as well), written unseparated from the word after it.

It looks like this:

<span style="font-size: 1.7em">בִּ</span>

BLB's "Simplified Hebrew Grammar PDF says this:

<blockquote>|The Inseparable Prepositions
 There are three prepositions in Hebrew that are always attached to the word they are
modifying, and that is why they are called “inseparable.” These three prepositions, with
their primary meanings, in alphabetical order are: <span style="font-size: 1.7em">ב</span> – “in, by, with”; <span style="font-size: 1.7em">כ</span> – “as, like,
according to”; <span style="font-size: 1.7em">ל</span> – “to, for, at.” Now all of these prepositions have other translations as well (e.g., “among & before” for <span style="font-size: 1.7em">ב</span> – “thus & after” for <span style="font-size: 1.7em">כ</span>; “into & concerning” for <span style="font-size: 1.7em">ל</span>, and
many others for all three), but the first ones listed are the ones they are primarily
identified with.|</blockquote>

As far as I have found so far, BLB doesn't offer a Strong's page for it? Because it's unseparated, it seems not to be possible, as far as I can see, to compare other uses on their site other than searching for some of the English words and manually checking each one. That would mean we would need to appeal to some other source that does give us access to that information, unfortunately. I have no idea what sources might, at time of writing.

With all those cautions said, it MAY imply "in" a three-dimensional space (in the sense of an open area) as in a vertical expanse.

If so it wouldn't fit with a solid sky, though other senses of "in" would work, and the word by itself probably doesn't specify either way, I'd guess.

If yes, it would weigh in on the extent of the expanse and would include outer space. We know the expanse includes air due to considerations in the rest of Genesis 1 (see later). And I think the waters above almost certainly include clouds. If the waters above included the original material transmuted into the astronomical bodies later on Day 4, this would all fit with the expanse including both the atmosphere and outer space.

Otherwise it could simply mean the same sense as our "in the sky." I do see evidence that it might, since the word for heavens in the later chapters of Job refer to cloud cover Job and his friends are looking at as that. So whatever someone sees when they look up is "in" the heavens, in the sky, in the expanse in a sense, without the literal location of the expanse/heavens needing to include outer space per se.

###### Nye's Moonshine

A good example of a bad interpretation approach is seen with a misrepresentation of something in this section (still in 1(Genesis).1:14-19; quoted [above](#1genesis114-19-lights-in-the-expanse)) by Bill Nye, the Science DeNyer, in a bad argument I've called Nye's Moonshine.

That is the wild claim that this passage says the moon produces its own light.

(Rather than simply being silent on it or indeed implying it reflects the sun's light; either of these is more likely but Nye assumes for self-serving reasons otherwise.)

If it isn't silent on the question, the only evidence we have one way or another is that the word for "lesser" can mean dependant. If that sense is intended here, it would imply the moon is dependant on the sun. (Or it might simply mean the light that isn't as bright or hot.)

The argument claims that there's positive evidence in the use of the word translated "give light" or shine (that's one word).

But if you just look through all the other example uses, you see two that clearly they would not have thought implied producing their own light, of twinkling eyes, and of sunlight reflecting off of waves in water.

Also no ancient could have thought the moon gives off its own light, since they could see as plainly as we can that when the side that isn't pointed toward the sun is visible, it isn't lit up (not enough for the eye to see, generally, other than during lunar eclipses).

Moderns spend so much time indoors, staring at electronic screens and the like, that this might somehow be lost on them, or attribute knowledge of how it works to modern science alone without thinking through the rather obvious; that the dark side (don't confuse with far side) of the moon is visible for most of every month. (Or rather, not lit, so not as visible, but understandable by contrast with the light side's shape, and by occlusion of stars).

Also remember, we're using to discerning what month it is by an electronic number on our phones or a paper calendar on the wall and the like -- but ancients were focused on lunar months, which is known for Hebrews, in fact.

So they were not only looking at nature in general more than moderns, they were paying attention to the moon's phases.

To salvage the Moonshine argument, you would need to (other than getting so drunk on moonshine it might seem to make sense to you) assume that the ancients would have thought that the side that just happens to be exactly where it would be the sun's light bouncing, at all times, is somehow not affected by the sun's light, and yet is producing its only light, but only right where the sun's light is hitting it, and selectively not generating light on the parts that it isn't.

This is obviously against parsimony; it adds useless ad hoc rescuing hypotheses, and the only reason to add them is if you're a modern skeptic wanting to use eisegesis to read something into the text that isn't there, to deceptively claim a problem.

Relevant passages:

On "lesser" (Strong's H6996):

Most meanings are younger, smaller, minor.

Dependant is true of many of the younger cases, though not necessarily in view with the word itself. 

It is in view here:

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/2nd Samuel 12:3 but the poor man had nothing, except one little H6996 ewe lamb, which he had bought and raised. It grew up together with him and with his children. It ate of his own food, drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was like a daughter to him./</span></blockquote>

The primary meaning (as with the moon) isn't about dependancy (here it's little/young, with the moon it's dim), but the rest of this verse clarifies the lamb is dependant on the man within the parable Nathan is telling.

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/Job 3:19 The small H6996 and the great are there.
The servant is free from his master./</span></blockquote>

Some of the verses before this show normal parallelism, so it's likely in view here, though not all of the verses just before it are clearly parallel. My studies on meaning of the word here translated "slave" (ebed) show that other than criminals, which, to be fair, are evidently in view in the prior verse, means debt-caused indentured servitude (or poverty-caused). They were not slaves as properly defined (see [here](BibleIsAntiSlavery)), but more like a cross between adopted family members and servants, working for room and board (as in for survival) rather than a salary (per se, though they often were given allowances).

Thus, if that sense is in mind here, they were dependant on the "masters" for survival. The previous verses do move to different subjects on each line, so most likely this is moving on from prisoner "slavery" to debt "slavery" and thus likely has the dependant connotation.

Either way, it also has an "under authority" connotation which would also work to imply the moon's light is "under the sun's authority", not its own light.

Similar:

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/Isaiah 36:9 How then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least H6996 of my master’s servants, and put your trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?/</span></blockquote>

Survival dependance seems less in view here but the under authority sense again clearly is. Dependance in the sense of dependant for orders, at least (in both cases).

For "give light" (Strong's H215):

It's also used for "lights" and many meanings have that. Many others describe things like flames that do indeed clearly produce their own light.

The exceptions are:

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/1st Samuel 14:27 But Jonathan didn’t hear when his father commanded the people with the oath. Therefore he put out the end of the rod that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes brightened H215./</span></blockquote>

Also in verse 29:

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/1st Samuel 14:29 Then Jonathan said, “My father has troubled the land. Please look how my eyes have brightened H215 because I tasted a little of this honey./</span></blockquote>

NET <span class="bbq">/gleamed/</span>. Some translations interpret it as becoming able to see, but there's no hint in the context of an inability to see. It clearly means the honey tasted good and satisfied hunger, so his eyes twinkled.

This is obviously caused by outside light reflecting off, not the eyes producing their own light; nobody could take it that way, or else if someone made the same expression at night, people would see their eyes glowing from it.

This is clearly a nromal figure of speech in their culture for being happier or less afflicted. Seen again here:

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/Ezra 9:8 Now for a little moment grace has been shown from Yahweh our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a stake in his holy place, that our God may lighten H215 our eyes, and revive us a little in our bondage./</span></blockquote>

It may be in view here:

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/Job 33:30 to bring back his soul from the pit,
that he may be enlightened with the light H215 of the living./</span></blockquote>

Others include Psalm 19:8, probably Proverbs 29:13 (though this could mean give sight, and there was another earlier I didn't list that I think means the latter, Psalm 13:3), and possibly figuratively Ecclesiastes 8:1 (though this may instead be figurative for a face producing its own light). 

And:

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/Job 41:32 He makes a path shine H215 after him.
One would think the deep had white hair./</span></blockquote>

Deep refers to deep water. This means a wake (as LSB translates the word WEBP here calls path) in water, with whitecaps, and sunlight reflecting off of it, obviously not producing its own light.

Many cases of things like dawn giving light may connotate air and/or clouds being lit too (such as Proverbs 4:18), though those might be just implying the sun's direct shining, so I didn't show them.

Similar:

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/Ezekiel 43:2 Behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east. His voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth was illuminated H215 with his glory./</span></blockquote>

Ezekiel could hardly think the land was shining on its own here.

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/20 God said, “Let the waters abound with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the sky.” 21 God created the large sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind. God saw that it was good. 22 God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.” 23 There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day./</span></blockquote>

The word translated "creatures" is nephesh, the term for soul in OT (body plus spirit; the tangible with the intangible, akin to hardware and software).

Occasionally I see people thinking that animals don't "have" souls. That's not how it works. They aren't created in the image of God, but they "have" (or more properly "are", in the OT sense of soul) souls.

In the New Testament, the word translated soul can be used interchangeably more for the same meaning as spirit. Neither connotate a created ghostly substance that detaches from the body at death as many moderns imagine; it simply means the non-substance/immaterial essence of what makes us living, denoting motion, thought, emotion, things made out of arrangements of stuff rather than just another type of stuff.

Our continuance after death could simply be God causing that to happen directly; he is hardly dependant on having created something else to detach for whether he wants to continue us in another body after death. This includes a temporary afterlife (which clearly includes conscious life) with some kind of temporary body (perhaps simply something like a dream avatar) and the future resurrection into the permanent bodies of the New Creation.

It's of course also possible that God did create something (perhaps the body of the temporary afterlife) already during this life, and it might detach at our deaths, but since God is omniscient, this has no bearing on whether we continue in the afterlife, or whether animals do. If he wants them to, and if he knows it's right for them to do so, they will, however he does it. And the use of words like soul or spirit have nothing (at least not directly) to do with whether that is already the case or not. We would need to be informed of this by other means.

Here the word is being used as a wide category of things that are souls -- specifically, in context, organic things with souls, so "creatures" is indeed a good translation.

###### Sea Creatures, Air Creatures

The first phrase is describing, as a category, all creatures that swim or otherwise are in the water, unless they are instead in the other two categories.

The second phrase is poorly translated usually, and here; it doesn't only mean birds (as in with feathers); it means flying creatures. The parallelism here makes that clear to water creatures in general (not just to fish).

Birds isn't an absolutely horrible translation; it works too as long as you read it as a synecdoche (example within the set, in this case of flying creatures, used figuratively as the label for the set), since the vast majority of other uses of the word do refer specifically to birds.

But it doesn't strictly only mean birds; it would include bats (as it does in Leviticus 11:13-19 and Deuteronomy 14:11-18) as well as flying insects and pterosaurs.

Ignorance of this is used by some populist skeptics today to foolishly claim that the Bible wrongly thinks bats are birds.

###### Across the Face of Sky

To {/fly above the earth across the face of the expanse of the heavens/} (as better translated by LSB) is taken by many who affirm the spherical world-Earth as proof that the expanse/heavens is air.

While it may imply that, it gets that meaning from a later verse in this chapter that defines this clearly. Here, it's a bit ambiguous on its own and we should be honest. Many translations, unfortunately, with good intentions no doubt, use a much more thought-for-thought approach with 1:20 and obscure the word "face" and will make it sound like the Hebrew here directly says that birds fly in the expanse. A case can be made for this (read on) based on face as well, but it's fair to say that it doesn't say it on its own.

That case would be if the face (surface) of the expanse is meant as an upper surface of a fluid-like substance (air), which we could support with a parallel in later passages with fish in water -- and fish are under the "face" of water (compare 1:2 which talks about this face). However, this arguably begs the question of whether the expanse/heavens are or include air versus being something above the air. A solid-skyer will argue that the expanse (they would say firmament) is the solid dome, and its face its visible inner surface.

In fact, Dr. Danny Faulkner says in his book Falling Flat (with his debunkings of countless Flattener arguments -- Flattener being my term for those who try to argue for the Bible teaching a flat world-Earth or solid sky) that he suspects the face of the heavens IS the atmosphere, with the rest of the heavens being outer space and the astronomical bodies, which makes some sense.

Either way, note that the word translated across in LSB is still not translated ideally; it's the word for "on" or "over" again -- the one that if the observer is below would mean "under" or "on the lower surface of". Also the same word translated "above" in relation to the earth in the same verse (20).

This implies that there is an observer who is on the earth or close to it, looking up at the face of the sky.

In Faulkner's suggested interpretation, technically the birds and observer are literally in the very lowest part of that face (the atmosphere), or it may fit better with the idea of the face as the upper surface (or region where it fades) of the atmosphere.

The latter case seems slightly more parsimonious to me in light of Job and others using "heavens" of anything visible when you look up plus that a later verse does teach that birds are in the heavens (the one that I think makes a solid case for that, unlike verse 20 per se), so that when the sky is completely overcast, the "face" of the heavens would not include the stars, sun, or moon. This supports a sense of the nearest visible things above the air that we are directly in (other than things like ceilings and trees).

That would indeed support that "face" means upper surface of the literal expanse/heavens, while being "in" the sky doesn't have to mean literally in but can mean "visible through" when stars are not obscured by clouds.

Alternatively, if waters above means clouds, the separation/distance/expanse literally adjusts in height depending on the cloud, so a sense of distance between the viewer on land and the clouds or the astronomical bodies would all literally fit with expanse, and thus heavens since the expanse of Genesis 1 is named the heavens.

###### NJ Isn't New Jersey

Note: I didn't mention it yet, but heaven/heavens here has nothing to do directly with the afterlife realm. In Luke 16 it's made clear that the realm of the saved in some sense is next to the realm of the unsaved, separated by a chasm (or at least where the pre-atonement saved were).

Most likely "heaven" is associated with the afterlife realm and God's dwelling for two reasons.

First, as figurative for better. Up is often figurative in most languages for good, down for bad; things are improving means things are looking up, etc. Since the word heavens originally was the name given to the sky, this figure applies to the afterlife realm of the saved, and to where God has a heavenly temple and so forth.

Second, the New Jerusalem throughout Revelation appears to be a hovering city invisible in the sky (not physically literally in our plane of existence per se, but in the vision it is portrayed this way). So God's throne may have always been there in some way (again, not physically accessible to us now, not like a spaceship hovering or anything). Some of the context makes it clear the actual sky is above this, but from the perspective of John when he taken in the vision down to the land, the New Jerusalem is above him.

After the new creation starts, it seems that everything else is un-instantiated, and the new creation is instantiated, while the New Jerusalem remains, and then lowers to land on the new earth. Thus, this is clearly the same place that John is seeing parts of throughout the earlier parts of the vision.

And it's made clear that at least after the atonement, the saved at least can be present there, so it's the centerpiece of the final creation as well as of the temporary afterlife realm for the saved (of the present "heaven" in the afterlife sense).

So in short, since this hovers in the sky (in the heavens), it gains that name by association.

###### You Monster

WEBP's {/large sea creatures/}, LSB has as {/great sea monsters/}. The word LSB puts as monsters is tanninim. What precisely this means I haven't personally studied yet. IIRC AiG had a study on it several years ago as an article on their site.

But I would suggest based on this verse that it probably refers to larger sea creatures, such as (perhaps including) whales, plesiosaurs, kronosaurs, ichthyosaurs, etc. The word is often translated as serpents, although it isn't the same word translated that in Genesis 3 (that's nakhash). But it might refer specifically to the great sea reptiles, or perhaps to large sea creatures with scales so could include things like a whale shark, megaladon, or even a great white shark.

It's translated jackals in Job 30:29 and 44:19 in LSB, but IIRC this may be translator bias at play. Some are translated dragon. In general it seems possible to read it as referring to scaly creatures. It doesn't always by itself connotate a large creature, as it's used in parallel with cobra. Here the referrent obtains the large connotation from the use of the word translated "great".

In any case, it clearly has no negative connotation yet, as this is pre-Fall.

###### Baramin

We're told in verse 21 that the sea creatures exist "after their kind" and likewise the flying creatures. We'll continue to see that reproduction occurs after the kind, the teaching of the created kind categories, after which the scientific term baramin was named.

Baramins (if it takes the English plural as I have seen it used) clearly aren't modern species (per se); "species" is often defined much more narrowly including behavioral reproductive isolation, and even geographic isolation, with merely different mixes of traits from within the larger created kind category then giving an appearance of isolated distinction, while actually being genetically compatible.

Also, after any such non-genetic isolation occurs, copying errors in the DNA (mutations, which aren't creative like pop culture tends to portray them as) can break their compatibility with other branches, resulting in actual genetic isolation, but as sub-branches of historical branches.

Surprisingly, some ignorant evolutionists have somehow gotten the idea that our model needs variety in genes to result from mutations post-Creation, even post-Fall. This obviously makes no sense; God can and presumably would create more genetic options in the genomes of original kind pairs (called created heterozygosity, meaning created variety).

Dr. Nathanael Jeanson has shown that the pattern toward "speciation" (isolation of branches within the baramin into differentiated groups that are behaviorally, geographically, and/or genetically isolated in reproduction) is faster earlier on when created heterozygosity is high, tending toward homogenization in each branch group over time, and that the timescale this would be expected to happen over fits the biblical one.

God could, though, also create spots on the genome where mutations aren't harmful, or not as seriously so as the ones that lead to rapid death, to allow for opening up of even more variety post-Creation. Dr. John Woodmorappe also highlighted studies that showed that, in fact, recovery of lost pre-Flood variety could occur in these spots within the shorter timespan post-Flood!

Some unusually ignorant evolutionists also object in various illogical ways like just saying "that's all evolution". Of course, this is just equivocation fallacy; it's obvious our view, among biblical creationists, is that God miraculously created the bulk of the DNA. This is like programming the shape and structure and logic of the design with "sliders" for size and color and the like, of the whole creature and of features of the creature, where various settings for the sliders doesn't change survivability much. "Evolution" properly used on this topic doesn't merely mean change; it means the aspects of NON-creationist views that try to replace the supernatural creation component.

Which, by the way, has been debunked as scientifically plausible in a number of ways CMI, AiG, etc. highlight.

###### Fish of Seas Are in Water

In verse 22 we have the last of several passages that give preparatory definitions that will add up, with other verses shortly, to defining birds as in the air. Here it is that 1) sea creatures are in the waters in the seas, while 2) birds are "on" the earth. (Again, in context, can mean above.) So, for now, we aren't told yet what the birds are "of" but we will see it shortly, that they are of the expanse in parallelism with fish of the sea. Here we're told that being of the sea means being in the seas, filling the waters in the seas.

This will tell us that birds are in the expanse. They aren't in the earth; they rest on the earth (land) when not flying, and fly above the earth.

##### 1(Genesis).1:24-25 Good

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/24 God said, “Let the earth produce living creatures after their kind, livestock, creeping things, and animals of the earth after their kind;” and it was so. 25 God made the animals of the earth after their kind, and the livestock after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind. God saw that it was good./</span></blockquote>

I've already commented on most of the features earlier that are repeated here. It's worth noting that "good" is being used in a sense similar to what Jesus says that only God is good, though it might not imply total perfection per se, but as good as a finite created entity can be (that all such created entities were, at the time), since they still had the potential to fall. Words, of course, can be used in a wide range of senses, and Jesus wasn't saying that relative senses of good can't be used.

It's also worth mentioning that in ancient languages, typically words did have wider ranges of meanings than English words.

Many modern readers will tend toward assuming that a language can only have, or even should only have, one meaning per word, what I've called the one word one meaning error.

In reality, English is a pretty modern quirk of a language that it has collected such a vast vocabulary that in more cases, there is a single meaning, more or less, per word, and even that we have many words for various nuances and connotations of the same basic idea. While modern English has simplified in some ways versus ancient languages, usually it's toward less conjugations of words, so again toward the trend of one form of a word, one basic meaning.

Ancient languages by contrast, with exceptions of course, tended more to have more meanings in each word, and relied on contextual keys to select the intended meaning.

Is this better or worse?

Well, it's true that if God lets language develop naturally somewhat, it would take time for languages to build enough variety to cover more concepts. However, this has serious downsides, especially if you lose the culture and live speakers of all of our vast vocabulary and then have to rely on historical records to try to piece together what we meant. We're a dictionary culture, an encyclopedia culture, and now an internet culture. If none of those happened to survive, discerning many words in our language would be very difficult.

Having a smaller vocabulary would actually be easier, and observing patterns of the context selecting nuances of the word makes it easier as well to handle the distinctions.

So while the primary reason that Hebrew, and Greek for NT, are relatively simple compared to modern English is that they are over 2000 years earlier in development, it's actually a smart decision that God worked with these kinds of languages for his Word rather than trying to make them learn a new system based on the one-word-one-meaning rule. It makes the Bible much easier to translate and represent in other languages.

Even for English speakers this is often a problem as no matter how old we get, we continue to run into new words in our own language that we might have no idea what they mean, often even with the etymologies being unclear to us without looking it up (although that's in part due to our propensity to borrow heavily and almost freely from other languages).

##### 1(Genesis).1:26 Let us, Image/Likeness, Dominion, Birds of Sky, God Created

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/26 God said, “Let’s make man in our image, after our likeness. Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the sky, and over the livestock, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.” 27 God created man in his own image. In God’s image he created him; male and female he created them./</span></blockquote>

###### Let us Create / God Created

Within these two verses, we have another confirmation that God is carrying out the "Let us" orders, not angels. Unitarians who rely on the angels interpretation of the "us" have to appeal to embedding to explain verse 27. Embedding is a real feature of their language culture, where a servant's actions can be referred to as the master's actions. However, in light of Genesis 1:2-3, it's clear that the Spirit of God is the one most directly carrying out the orders, and in light of 2:4 and authorial avoidance, again it's clear it's directly God creating.

Also, to create a human would seem to likely be beyond the capabilities of angels, unless angels are created in turn by God with such powers, which doesn't change that this is still God's creative power at play even if angel embedding is in view here against the evidence. I don't argue that angels can't have such power per se; it does seem like they can take human form because two of them appear to have done so in the case of Sodom and Gomorrah, but it would be a stretch to think they could create the many other things throughout Genesis 1.

Even if so, we still have features of the text that show that a different Person of God (since authorial avoidance is about personal honor) than the speaker here (the one called simply God, who we Trinitarians identify as the Father) is implying personal credit for the creative action, and to a lesser but more direct degree, the Spirit too. So this would still require that the "us" refer to three Persons in the Trinity, each in charge of delegating orders to angels. This hardly gets a Unitarian out of the evidence for the Trinity!

We also should not claim that the text means something that there is nowhere any evidence that it does.

The reality of embedding language only tells us that this COULD have been an option, but there would still be a hint in the text somewhere that it was meant. Here there's no such hint. Unitarians offer no claims of such, that I have seen, relying simply on their denial of Trinitarianism to claim that alone is the hint, which is circular reasoning. At this point if they start trying, I would be automatically suspicious, as it would be unlikely they would genuinely have been intended to hint at that yet that nobody picked up on it all that time.

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) | [Chapter List](#book-1-genesis) | [This Chapter's Observation Headers List](#genesis-1)
###### Meaning of Image of God?

Next we have image / likeness. Does this refer merely to physical form? Not if the dominion mandate is meant to be implied by being in God's image. Twice (here and in verse 28), image is stated, then dominion is stated. We can't assume that what comes after is caused by what came before (false cause fallacy), but it does suggest it might, especially when that pattern is repeated.

In verse 27, the one sometimes (as in ESV) formatted on multiple lines like the traditional format for poetry like the Psalms, it seems that male and female are seen as a parallel outflowing from being in God's image. Why would that be, since God seems to only be given male pronouns, not counting when gendered language for words are used about him (which happens for anyone in languages with gender for all their words, as with Hebrew and Greek)?

Probably this isn't about gender but about three persons, so another hint at God's trinitarian nature. A most basic family unit once a child has been born has three people in it. Yes, they are three separate beings, unlike God, but an image doesn't have to be identical in all ways; obviously they are necessarily finite/limited while God isn't, too. And one of them being a father, and one a child, fits the pattern of the Father and the Son. This isn't to say that the Spirit is female, but that having three persons in such a group mirrors God's tri-personality.

As such, being in God's image looks to clearly be about personality, so not about physical form. If God wanted to create images of God on some other planet where the human shape isn't the most ideal to be basically adaptable to life there, or if he had wanted them to be more akin to flying creatures or water creatures, their physical form would have probably looked different while their spiritual nature would be more like ours than like an animal.

Thus, in turn, I think that the dominion mandate is indeed not merely coincidentally twice mentioned after the image mention, but is also implied in what it means to be an image. We're to act as God's representatives within his creation, using our intelligence and empathy to guide and help animals where needed, and to keep plants in order.

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) | [Chapter List](#book-1-genesis) | [This Chapter's Observation Headers List](#genesis-1)
###### Aliens?

What about the possibility of aliens with their own planets, their own non-image life to help?

While nothing that I have yet noticed here in Genesis 1 directly seems to comment on it, Genesis 2 and 3 introduce the idea that death and suffering come from human sin, and that this affects nature too. On their own, they at least open up the question of whether that extends to all of creation or not, and Romans weighs in with at least one superlative in {/whole creation/} toward that in 8:22, and several repeats of "creation" earlier. Arguably the word "creation" is itself a superlative so these repetitions would make it a literal-all, most likely, not mere hyperbole or "rounding up."

If the curse affected all creation, it seems it would be unfair that Adam's sin applied to them too. Of course, it's possible the same natural instability of finite souls to eventually sin that applies to humans would cause them to sin before any causal effect of either sin on either of any two planets would reach the other. This would suggest at least that likely no aliens are close to us. If some aliens are sinless, they would probably need to be so in a way like how the unfallen angels evidently are. While we aren't told what that way is, it seems that this same instability implies that the only known way is through God sharing experiential knowledge to them without having them actually live it out, in something like a knowledge download. This would put them more in the category of an angel-like lifeform, not likely like a human.

If such existed in our "plane of reality", so that we could observe them living, made of atoms, etc., and they stayed unfallen, they would presumably need to be so distant the light from their world wouldn't reach ours before the end of the fallen era. Or else they would need to have an angel-like function for us, which seems unlikely as a separate type of entity from angels.

This is complicated and it isn't on-topic here to settle this definitively, but the seemingly most parsimonious default expectation is that material life is probably only here, and that angels are the only other sapient lifeform (other than God himself, of course).

###### Dominion Mandate Isn't Violent

Many critics (and some holding to compromise views, even) claim that the words dominion (in verse 26) and subdue (in 28) are intrinsically violent, and thus they distort the dominion mandate into a right to essentially abuse the creation. However, their reasoning for doing so commits an anachronism fallacy in seeing other later uses that are post-Fall as applying to pre-Fall. In the whole context of the entire Bible it's obvious that God's ideal of ruling isn't "lording it over" as Jesus puts it at the footwashing, but loving service.

In some of the examples, the logic is also backward even without that context, as they compare the ease with which God will lead to the defeat of a corrupted nation to the pruning of a plant. This isn't saying that you should prune plants "violently" (whatever that would mean). It's saying that you shouldn't be evil, to get pruned at all.

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) | [Chapter List](#book-1-genesis) | [This Chapter's Observation Headers List](#genesis-1)
###### Birds of the Air

Finally, 1:26, and again in 1:28, have our parallelism with the "fish of the sea" to "birds of the sky."

Notice that all the phrasings of land animals are careful to avoid "of the land" in these constructions too; they instead say "on" the earth, until verse 30, which carefully removes fish from the phrasing, to avoid confusion that the parallel there to birds necessarily makes beasts "of" the earth as IN the earth. (Though of course some are, as moles.)

This strongly suggests that the parallel is intentional, and is saying that birds are of the raqiya (expanse, named heavens) in the same way fish are of the seas / waters, which was defined already as "in" the waters (in case you didn't know).

That it repeats this pattern twice, and then avoids the pattern when beasts "of" the earth are in view, is a clear sign of intentionality.

The implication of this is that the raqiya isn't a firmament; isn't a solid thing.

If a Flattener wants to support a solid dome or solid sphere sky, they need to look elsewhere than the word raqiya here to do it. This raqiya in Genesis 1 is (or includes) air.

Translators of the earlier "across the face of the expanse" as "in the expanse" are rightly communicating the thought there, but we learn that from these constructions, not directly from that verse. So thought-for-thought translations of that passage aren't wrong, but we should be clear that they don't reflect the grammar within that verse itsellf. Even so, we don't need them to, because the reason those translations are conveying an accurate idea is that it's stated in these other passages.

##### 1(Genesis).1: 28-30 Greenatarianism

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/28 God blessed them. God said to them, “Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the sky, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.” 29 God said, “Behold,‡ I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree, which bears fruit yielding seed. It will be your food. 30 To every animal of the earth, and to every bird of the sky, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food;” and it was so./</span></blockquote>

I've covered most aspects of this already. What's left is mostly that before the Flood (as we find out later), only what's green is given for food, or, presumably, fruit of any color coming from plants that have green leaves, since fuit are mentioned too.

One interesting question is whether the forbidden fruit had seeds. This specifies that which has seeds is given to eat. Would there be a point to a fruit with no seeds? Well, we know a point to that fruit other than seeds, so in that one case, yes there would be. There are three repeats of superlatives here, two of them clarifying with seeds. This would suggest a literal all, of all fruit that have seeds may be eaten.

Of course, a literal all can still have stated exceptions, and the exception will be stated shortly in the next chapter. Is this close enough? It's possible. Even with Genesis 1:1 to 2:4 being most likely the account of the pre-Incarnate Christ and the account with the mention of the forbidden fruit being Adam's, this is still possible, as I think it would be clear that the Lord most likely taught Genesis 1:1 to 2:4 to Adam and Eve, and Adam's account after it is intended to go with it. The Lord would foreknow that Adam would be recording the warning about that tree, and that wouldn't even require omniscience to guess, so he would expect his readers to understand, without having his omniscience, that he didn't need to specify here an exception they were about to read.

All that said, this is POSSIBLE evidence that the forbidden tree did not create seeds. This would make sense based on its purpose; if the instructions are "don't eat the tree here," one easy way to ensure nobody (if they had been perfectly obedient already) would do so is to ensure that tree only stays there. Of course, God also foreknew they would sin very early, so this might be a moot point. I think God would most likely design things the best way to accommodate the possibility that they wouldn't, though, even if they would, since he himself can't sin. However, it could still be dealt with, by having each child in a hypothetical alternate sinless timeline be brought at least once to that tree before they are old enough to pick their own food, and trained to recognize the one that is there, so that they could recognize its copies elsewhere.

So I find that interesting question unsettled either way.

And that isn't unsettling.

What about whether we should return to eating only plants?

Well, it's made clear in the NT that the Christian covenant is a branch off of the Abrahamic. This is a branch off of the Noahic, and in all three of these, meat is still eaten. The NT specifically says that eating meat is acceptable, because the topic came up in the need to clarify that the specific rules of the Mosaic covenant no longer apply about WHICH meat we may eat. So at the very least, we MAY eat meat still, provided some other conditions not stated don't obtain in which it becomes morally wrong to do so.

That is, if it's still needed for nutrition purposes, and if alternatives like lab-grown meat MAY still have unknown health problems such as long-term hidden influences toward cancer, which will be likely within at least 100 years or so of its invention, we should probably err on the side of caution and prefer some meat in our diet.

Some people can get by on just a plant diet, allegedly, but the range of what's available for this is likely lessened as a result of the Flood, as well as possibly genetic decay due to the Fall in general. And those plants already existed in the NT era, and yet there was no command to limit food only to those. It seems unwise to stake our whole survival on a tiny range of foods, so here again, it seems best to include at least some meat, sometimes.

What about Daniel's eating of vegetables only? This wasn't likely about being anti-meat but about meat sacrificed to idols, the king's food, and likely the specific foods offered also weren't as healthy. It's highly unlikely that Daniel is preserving some kind of otherwise lost hint of a greenery-only diet.

(I'm not saying "vegetarian" in most cases here, because evidently some who use the term actually eat fish! Obviously fish weren't included in what is allowed here pre-Flood for consumption. It's a bizarre quirk of modern language that somehow "vegetarian" can include a thing with a brain. Clearly this is an unwise use of language. So we have "veganism" to imply what really vegetarianism would imply... plus the term may be confusing due to the common trend of categorizing plant foods as either fruits or else vegetables. Here I mean all plant products, if not poisonous or otherwise harmful.)

Note that post-Fall, pre-Flood, humans actually were, evidently, sacrificing animals, for animal skins and a temporary atonement symbol foreshadowing Christ's atonement, and in fact, evidently God killed the first animal for the original clothes' animal skins. Part of Cain's problem was that he wasn't sacrificing animals.

However, it seems that the meat of the sacrificed animals wouldn't be eaten by humans.

What was done with it? Possibly it was all burned in altars. Some of it could have been used for defensive traps against animals which due to genetic decay were already eating meat as well.

Note that we see preserved in the fossil layers, which are almost entirely Flood or post-Flood, and in many layers known to be Flood for sure, that meat-eating was indeed happening by the time of the Flood among animals.

One final note; compromise views try to say that death only applied to humans due to sin, and try to retcon the fossil layers as evolutionary records and Genesis as supposedly not commenting on whether it applied to animals, but notice it's clear here that the limitation to plant diets is on all animals as well. So the layers preserving meat-eating proof are clearly post-Fall, and made in the Flood (in at least virtually all of the lower layers' case, and the question of Flood or post-Flood for higher layers is irrelevant to this). And we even have multiple superlatives for the animals, although to be fair, two of them are in separate subcategories (earth and sky), but then the eath one has a second repeated, so it's most likely literally absolute at least for them. This is crystal clear that the curse of Genesis 3 is the start of death and suffering for animals too, not only for humans.

Our chapter divisions (unfortunately) split here (though it may be fortunate in that it doesn't in this case, unlike others, appear to show bias for sig-before or transition-before, about toledoth lines, unlike 5:1a), and my navigation structure requires I put the Genesis 2 header here, but you should consider this a continued quoting next; the header just above goes with content below as well.

##### 1(Genesis).1:31 to .2:3 Very Good, Sabbath Rest, Fall of Satan Timing? (CONTINUED)

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/2:1 The heavens, the earth, and all their vast array were finished. 2 On the seventh day God finished his work which he had done; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done. 3 God blessed the seventh day, and made it holy, because he rested in it from all his work of creation which he had done./</span></blockquote>

Very good is said to be about as close to perfection as you could get in the Hebrew language, suggesting what we do see played out in Genesis 3, that there is still a potential for a Fall, but that otherwise humans and indeed all else were unfallen.

The rest here means a cessatio of activity, not that God got tired, and Exodus 20 and Jesus in passages like in Matthew 19 teach that God created in six days and rested on the seventh to live out an example for us to follow in our work week.

Notice 1:31, if literally absolute, constrains the fall of Satan to after this point. Most likely also it was after Day 7 as well, as it seems unlikely it would be fully holy until after that.

By the way, there is a popularist view that tries to see elaboration on the fall of Satan in a passage in Isaiah and one in Exekiel. While this can't be absolutely ruled out, it's questionable to repeat that idea as if it were definitively proven. The direct targets of those passages are human rulers. Of course, it's implied and even taught elsewhere that the rulers of the world in the pagan systems had demons ultimately behind them in some way, so a double application is possible, but JPH cautions that this was not known to be an existent view until 300 AD.

In the Isaiah case, 14:12-22, very little in it would immediately seem to be Satan, except by begging the question that "Lucifer" is Satan's "original name", a theory that is based on this very passage. "Son of the morning" may have contextual data we could check, and I haven't at time of writing. Fallen from heaven might be taken that way, but as we saw, "heaven" can mean good, and a verse after it says that the reason this person "fell from heaven" is that he thought to ascend to it in the first place. In Job, we're told that Satan in fact DOES visit heaven sometimes, or did before the Christian era at least, with various challenges, defeated then by God. So this would actually seem to suggest this can't be Satan, and that the falling from heaven happens after the attempt to ascend, which fails, so more like jumping up and expecting to just keep going up, but instead landing with a deadly crash.

The previous verses that lead up to this are also directly about human rulers who die and are buried in the ground, having maggots in their dead bodies. We're also told in verse 16 that the king in question is a man.

So the leap to heaven here is the worldly idea that gaining worldy gains, like being a government ruler to lord it over the poor, a model we see repeated in almost all modern politicians still to this day to some extent, and the fall from that heaven is death. (And possibly other failures.) So it seems clear that Satan isn't even poetically in view here.

The morning star would just be saying that they tried to leap into the heavens and shine brightly with honor and authority among men. As for "Lucifer," it simply means day star; the same meaning as the morning star, a star bright enough that you can see it before all other stars at night, and for longer than the others in the morning. Specifically, this is just the king of Babylon, apparently.

Ezekiel 28 also explicitly corrects the recipient's view to that he is "but a man", in verse 2. It's also about wealth and presumarly selfish use of it, in verses 4-5 while still clearly about a man, the "prince" of Tyre (admittedly "prince" might imply a demon in general, but here it says it's a man).

Verse 7 says that foreign nations would draw swords and cut this person down, and his reign. This seems clearly again to have to be a human ruler.

8 says he would die and be buried (pit).

Verse 9 repeats again that he is "but a man", and asks if he will claim otherwise while he's in the hands of those who kill him.

Perfection and Eden are brought up in 13, but in a 'strange' context that doesn't seem to resemble anything we're told about Eden in Genesis 1-3, of precious stones. These might be symbolic of the scales of the serpent of Genesis 3, though. But it seems that what this is doing is comparing the fall of this human to the fall of Satan, not giving us new data about the fall of Satan. It doesn't seem to mean that the man in question was literally perfect. It looks more like it's saying that he was relatively closer to perfectly, a lot more than he became when he allowed himself to become conceited and arrogant, and that this mirrors Satan's literal former perfection.

Verse 14 might genuinely give us new information, in saying poetically that this human king was an anointed guardian cherub. However, Michael Heiser, though his claims can't be relied on as certain as he has been shown to be in error on some things, but we can't assume everything he taught was error either, has said that the word for cherub, which we were told were there in Genesis 3 post-Fall, meant a guardian serpent. So this would seem not to be new information at all, but just further backup for us that the people of the time understood the word that way. So, by calling the tempter the Nakhash, it seems (if this is all correct) that it is saying Satan was a guardian serpent of the garden, perhaps of the tree itself, and he ate of the very thing he was supposed to prevent anyone from eating of.

Verse 14 also says the recipient of this chastisement was "on the holy mountain of God; in the midst of the stones of fire". What does this mean? Based on the opening of Isaiah, this seems to by comparing the human king to a different cherub, not to Satan directly. It's unclear if Satan would already have been visiting the throne room of God pre-Fall or if he was always assigned to the forbidden tree. It seems a stretch now to take this statement as confiring the former, when it may simply be poetic language freely describing former glory of this human king. Of course, cherubim could have worked in shifts and wouldn't need to be there at all until Day 6.

Verse 15 would fit with both, though "blameless" is clearly used in a relative sense often, as with Noah, so this is compatible with the human king.

Verse 16, though, is where it seems to fall apart to think this could be Satan. There is no hint that his sin was abundance of trade or related to trade at all; this seems clearly to be grounded in what was said of the human king earlier.

So while the Ezekiel case MIGHT help confirm how Genesis 1-3 was understood in relation to Satan, it also doesn't seem to be giving us any new information, and isn't actually talking about Satan, but just poetically comparing this human king to aspects of Cherubim in general and likely an implication of Satan's fall.

##### 1(Genesis).2:4 Toledoth of the LORD God

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/4 This is the history of the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Yahweh† God made the earth and the heavens./</span></blockquote>

Here's the verse key to the question of the meanings of toledoth lines (lines with the toledoth in them, being Strong's H8435, plural of a form of yalad (Strong's H3205 meaning beget, bring forth); -oth is the feminine plural). Let's put the actual wording directly here this time from LSB:

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/Gen 2:4 -
These are the generations  of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that [fn]Yahweh God made earth and heaven./</span></blockquote>

If this is an end-signature line, it makes sense that it would go right after the creation account which included things no human could yet know and would be signed by the LORD God / Yahweh God. See several comments earlier on the hints of authorial avoidance as well. This is very similar to Mark and John not using their own names within their works but signing their names to the work itself (in their cases to scroll tags, what we know as the titles).

When I was a child, before having access to any interlinear, other places where this word is translated seemed to be assuming it was about introducing a genealogy, which did often follow. This would make sense of the "begat". However, we have nothing like that in this case.

And genealogies make sense to open accounts, establishing credentials of the authors, so if they were preceded by another account in a compilation like Genesis, and if the toledoth lines at the time were end-signatures, we would see that pattern later.

Whereas this account is about the God who has no beginning, so has no genealogy, as Hebrews also says (7:3, referring more to Melchizedek, but saying it's a fitting comparison to the divine nature of Christ, although he does have genealogies of his mother and his adoptive human father in Luke and Matthew).

So the sense of "coming forth from" probably simply means the account comes from the author -- so these are bylines.

Others argue that these aren't inherently genealogy-introducing lines but still don't go for the signature interpretation (whether end or start), with a more generic idea that the compiler himself, Moses, or later curators in a generational work of compiling older accounts with their own new accounts along the way. They must appeal to a definition of "toledoth" as clunky as a transition statement saying that what follows is what resulted from the person in question in various ways.

This idea is evidently popular even among scholars, but notice how un-parsimonious it is.

The perspectives match that the names in the lines in every case are the authors of the content, with the only difference being whether the byline is end or start in different cases, with the sole exception of the Naamah genealogy (if she is Noah's wife), which however clearly fits a pattern of later curators updating genealogical information as seen with the two consecutive genealogies of Esau, so isn't a problem.

We see several "previously on" summaries of what came before in many cases right after the line, showing it isn't just a transition in a larger work but represents the split between multiple formerly separate accounts.

In some cases the information repeated was only just stated in the previous account! We know that colophons existed in ANE cultures, and we know that later such lines preceded accounts, yet clearly none does precede Genesis 1:1-2:4, while the person who WOULD be cited in such a byline IS in 2:4!

We see an echoring of the same wording that opened Genesis 1-2:3 in "heavens and the earth", and a chiasm within the verse, and that sets up the second part of the chiasm to even reflect the first verse, 1:1! This seems to imply that the author of this section is the same author as of 1:1. This would fit with the idea that none of these are bylines at all, merely transitions written by Moses if he was originally writing the wording of the rest of this, but not with the idea that multiple authors are being quoted by Moses. And the idea that Moses is originating all of this wording doesn't fit with the many "previously on"s or the perspective-matches. Either way, this interpretation doesn't work at all, not even close to parsimoniously. If we're okay with a wildly unparsimonious interpretation, then okay, but I would rather go with what best fits the evidence unless the Scripture elsewhere tells me otherwise, as it doesn't as far as I know or proponents of that view have yet shown.

And this is even just scratching the surface; there is also that the only case that actually looks like a transition, in that wording on both sides depends on it to make sense, is in the one that in SAUA (Sig-After Until Abe) would be sons of Noah end-signature followed by the account end-signed by Shem, meaning Shem wrote both, with his brothers helping with the first one.

And that the Esau genealogies don't show up at all until Jacob is reconciled with him and visited by him, so likely he got a family document there.

And that after Abraham's account starts (he who visited Egypt), is when longer accounts start and also when the SAUA pattern finally breaks, and we have extrabiblical support that Moses, a prince of Egypt, wrote the Pentateuch on animal skins, so this may have been an Egyptian tradition that Abraham also could have learned from them already, a precursor to papyrus (which is thought not to have been used yet at these times), whereas the previous accounts may have been only oral or on tablets.

Is all of this just one giant coincidence, and toledoth lines are nevertheless merely transitions? Seems unlikely.

###### In the Day

Old-Earth compromise views also are argued from "in the day" here since this clearly refers at least to a whole week, so clearly the word for "day" can mean longer than 24 hours. This of course is simply strawmanning (whether intentionally or not) the biblical creationist position, since we're saying it's when yohm is used with a number and evening and morning and in context especially of day/night, as it is for Day 1, and number and evening/morning for the others.

I'm sure we've all seen, and gotten very tired of it, countless of them also pulling in "a day is like a thousand years". Suffice to say, the use of this to reinterpet this is debunked, and the repetition of it at this point is so tiresome, that for the purposes of this study I'll just refer the reader to CMI, AiG, etc. to read up, as everyone should have done before repeating the argument in the first place.

Finally, has the seventh day not ended? It has ended. Arguments to this end are similarly based on distortions and unwise assumptions, such as a passage from Hebrews taken out of context (which says only that the rest continues, not the day), or argument from silence that here it isn't explicitly stated that it ended.

That latter argument is so silly, it's clear, no offense to them, that those using it haven't thought it through; if it had said that the seventh day had ended, but didn't say it about the eighth, the same premise would insist the 8th day hadn't ended. And if for the 8th, then for the 9th, and so on. In even the shortest of interpretations of history of 6000 years, we have had around 6000 times about 365 days since then!

Of course, if you beg the question and ignore the clear definition of the days as day/night cycles, you might think that perhaps that "day" had indeed not ended yet, but you do have that definition and shouldn't ignore it. You witness multiple days passing by that definition, so you see with your own eyes that if the 7th day hadn't ended yet, it just was ended last night, at the very latest. By extrapolation, you realize it ended about 6000 years ago.

It's surely, in turn, reasonable for the author to not see the need to spell out to you what you can easily deduce on your own.

So if anything, the silence would seem to imply it did end, if silence ever means anything, and that if it hadn't, it would be weirder that we aren't told it didn't. (Since this isn't an argument purely on silence, but on the non-silence of that clear definition of a day/night cycle and of your own observation of other day/night cycles.)

###### Conclusion of First Toledoth Section; of LORD God account

I have up to now included every single verse of this foundational section of the Bible, as all of them were highly relevant to how to read, beyond merely what to read it as saying, though I have commented as well on what it seems to be saying on major topics also foundational.

I won't be doing that from now on, though for a while I might be including a lot of them since the early sections of Genesis are so rich with major details and much of it also relevant to interpretation. Some of the points about that have by now been repeated several times, so at some point without warning I will begin to drop reiteration of it. If you wonder why a passage isn't mentioned that could warrant a comment akin to ones I have already given and application to another branch of interpretation, it's to avoid this article becoming longer than the Bible.

I will have comments in other OT books too, but the most important for interpretation will begin with the gospels and the epistles.

As mentioned before, I may do the Proverbs study as relevant to interpretation as a completely separate article, though I might include major highlights here too; we'll see. Either way, the nagivation structure of this page will be left intact for Proverbs.

##### 1(Genesis).2:5-6 Of the Field, Rain Before Flood

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/5 No plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Yahweh God had not caused it to rain on the earth. There was not a man to till the ground, 6 but a mist went up from the earth, and watered the whole surface of the ground./</span></blockquote>

I already said pretty much what I wanted to say on this earlier, but including to show what I was alluding to there. To summarize (since I now forget where exactly I said it before here, to link to it), this probably just means that farm fields had not been planted, not denying that the plants used in them existed yet, and there is no contradiction of order of creation. And if SAUA, then Adam likely wrote the mention of rain, thus knew about rain, so it had to have (on that premise) rained before the Flood. (And SAUA, Sig-After Until Abe, is extremely well-supported as just covered.)

If you need more detail, I advise reading this article in its entirety anyways, so go back and read all that came before.

##### 1(Genesis).2:7-9 Dust, Breath, Soul, East, Eden, Put, Orchard/Arboretum, Pleasant-sight -> Good Food, Trees of Life and (Death)

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/7 Yahweh God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. 8 Yahweh God planted a garden eastward, in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had formed. 9 Out of the ground Yahweh God made every tree to grow that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food, including the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil./</span></blockquote>

This section is a great example of why I say this is such a rich section of Scripture. There's so much here that even quoting a few short verses makes it difficult to write a concise header for it. I could have split but I'm trying for less total sections now.

Dust means soil, dirt, or similar materials like clay in its dustlike form, silt, etc. It doesn't mean the dust in your house. Note dust "of the ground" and look at other uses on BLB, such as Genesis 26:15 where a well is stopped up with what is given this same word (LSB translates it earth there, but it's the same word as what here they call dust).

The words for breathed, breath, and soul are related, variants of nephesh and similar.

On this basis it's often argued that insects and similar aren't nephesh life, don't have souls. I think this is a stretch, so we shouldn't take it dogmatically, but it would make sense that Noah didn't need to take insects or arachnids or the like on the ark, for example. But I think all that's definitely going on here is a play on words for mnemonic purposes that draws on the fact that the dynamic immateriality of the spirit is similar to the motion of breathing.

Most likely God's manifestation didn't literally breathe at Adam here, though it's certainly possible, or at least that it wasn't literally needed to do so, but the imagery of doing so could be a way to physically act out the play on words itself. This latter idea could be seen as what Lewis in Narnia is doing when Aslan breathes on someone and, well, I guess I won't spoil it in case anyone has somehow not read Narnia. But this may be Lewis' idea only, and not necessarily actually done by the pre-incarnate Christ who I think was most likely present. Still, the language here could suggest it.

Of the four cardinal directions, only east is mentioned in Genesis 2:5 through 5:1a, several times, our first being here, that Eden is in the east. Post-Fall, Adam and Eve are driven out, evidently even further to the east, and Cain is cast out from that area even further to the east.

The relevance may be, in combination with geological reconstructions of the original supercontinent (note: not necessarily what is termed Pangaea, the most well-known term for that, but that's from secularist pseudoscience; suffice it to simply call it the original supercontinent and leave it at that, though biblical creationists may justifiably apply other terms to it), imply that the 

This is if "east" actually meant what it means here, versus just something like "over there".

One clarification; we often use "Eden" interchangeably with the Garden, and we can justifiably do that in most uses as a sort of reverse synecdoche (using the name for a category as if it was the name for the noteworthy member of the set), but 4:16 may imply that the whole of the land that is in the presence of the Lord, where people would go up (probably to the entrance to the Garden without going in) to where the Lord typically had a manifestation still, it seems in earlier chapter 4, to sacrifice. Whether this encompasses the lands of the four split-rivers is unclear to me at time of writing. But the land of Nod (wandering) seems to be east of the land of Eden, at least, per 4:16.

The word translated here "put" (WEBP) or "placed" (LSB) is interesting; does it mean God first created Adam elsewhere and then had him moved (or move on his own) to the Garden? This would explain "eastward".

How did the Lord put the man there?

Might it be something like in Ezekiel where a visible hand picks him up and moves him around, setting him perhaps on the mobile throne structure with the cherubim creatures described in that book?

Alternatively, "put" might just be reiterating the creation, and saying that it took place there in the garden.

This would seem to be possible; the word for put, Strong's H7760, is used in such a way in this example:

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/Gen 13:16 - “And I will make H7760 your seed as the dust of the earth, so that if anyone can number the dust of the earth, then your seed can also be numbered./</span></blockquote>

Here clearly "make" is a good translation. Other cases are translated laid or placed. The idea here seems to be that God would create (or cause to come to be, more properly) Abraham's descendants, and they would be placed on the earth, walking around and so forth. The placing where they are need not be a later event. So it's possible Genesis is here just saying that in creating Adam, Adam came to be in the garden.

What of eastward, then?

Well, we aren't told which direction the four rivers flow in. We aren't told how Eden gets its single source river, whether from a spring or something else.

I have wondered if the close association of Eden and mountain of God in Ezekiel, while it might not comment on Satan per se, might at least confirm that Eden was on a mountain, perhaps in a valley between two foothill ridges or the like, channeling water to the east.

Another combination of possibilities is that Adam was created anywhere, whether in the garden or not, then given a tour of the rivers, then brought (back?) to the garden.

In verse 15 shortly we'll see a phrasing of "Yahweh God took the man" after the discussion of the rivers, which seems to help support the idea of a move to the garden. This would possibly suggest that in fact the rivers flow to the west, and the tour happened there, and that the garden is on the west side. In that case, Eden might be a smaller area just around the garden and the possible mountain.

There's so little data we can't be sure of any of these possibilities, though.

It does seem most likely that mountains probably sourced the river and that the garden was east of one, so it's possible that there was a sort of throne place atop the mountain, where Adam may have been created, whether a tour then happened or not. Having a garden east of a raised place for God's theophany or theophanies to often say would allow morning sunlight to enable early work there, then the mountain would provide shade for the later afternoon, while the trees themselves would provide noon shade. So it seems most likely to me that these other rivers and lands are east of the garden, and that likely-steep rock fences the garden other than at the river entrance.

This likely implies that the lands mentioned are "sub-lands" of Eden, and Nod is thus likely a place less-well-watered, further to the east.

Current reconstructions have essentially North America and South America and Africa squeezed together, forming two points of a three-pointed shape, with most of what is now Asia, minus the India portion, pointing east. So the rivers might have all turned south, not watering well the Nod area.

Ironically, this richer area evidently turned much more violent than the Nod inhabitants on the whole, though clearly most Cainites did as well, and Lamech of that line seems quite violent. Many Cainites in Naamah's line have names that seem to praise the true God, though with the post-Flood use of "El" taken from Elohim for a Canaanite diety (distorted), such things could have happened pre-Flood too.

It thus seems likely that Noah built the ark far in the east, possibly near the city of Enoch, and possibly near an ocean coast, but also likely in a more mountainous area, likely lower mountains that don't get much of snow-caps. Geologically it looks likely that the main area of runaway subduction began very near there, so the steam walls would have been visible, and indeed, in an ark-passenger-POV section the fountains of the deep are described, so it seems that Noah likely was near that area and may have witnessed the initial after-effects of the cause of the cataclysm.

Next, note that although we call this a garden, it clearly is a tree-specific type of garden, and the trees are there both to be pleasant to look at and for their fruit to eat for the workers of the garden. As such, it might be more properly called an orchard or arboretum (arbor-eat-'em, we might say).

Often missed here is that we're told that the only types of fruit included are pleasant to sight, and good to eat. This would seem to explain an otherwise perplexing detail in Genesis 3 that Eve thought that she could see the quality of being good for obtaining wisdom about the forbidden fruit. It probably means that the fruit looked pleasant to the sight as well, and knowing the name of the tree, and that both God and the serpent agree on the detail that eating it would given knowledge of good and evil, that she assumes that the pleasant appearance helps confirm this. That is, that things in the garden with a pleasant appearance do fulfill their apparent purpose; in most cases, food, in this case, the gaining of this experiential knowledge of mixed good and evil.

How are the two special trees arranged?

Eve seems to think the forbidden tree is the one in the middle of the garden (LSB "midst" but means middle), in 3:3, and she would be seeing it, so it seems unlikely this is an error on her part. This seems to have to mean that it's the one most in the middle, and that the tree of life is not.

However, in 2:9, "midst" is stated for the tree of life, not for the forbidden tree per se. I think most likely it applies to both there.

One possible setup that would fit well with Revelation (read on) is that there are actually twelve trees of life, arranged in a circle around the forbidden tree. It may be that before the Flood, the NJ was taken up from the mountain, unless it was previously already hovering / in a different plane of reality + hovering or however that works. It seems it comes down in the new creation because sin and the fall and curse have been finally dealt with. It would make sense that it could be on the ground, then, on a vast mountain, or a smaller structure similar to it and it was expanded later perhaps, before the Fall, and might have remained until the Flood neared. Then the tree of life may have been intentionally preserved on this thing, and the saved can be given access to it. If so, this would in turn imply that the temporary body of the saved in the temporary afterlife may already be physical, but not quite as fully improved per se as the future resurrection body.

This would explain Jesus statement to the repentant thief on the cross that "today" he would be with him in "paradise".

Revelation describes the tree of life as giving twelve different crops, possibly meaning there are twelve sub-types of the tree of life, one per month of the year. If this is the case, and if it was already like this originally, it would make sense to need a ring of them around the forbidden tree, and thus the tree (plural) of life is indeed in the middle of the garden.

Alternatively, it could simply be another individual tree and it's just relatively closer to the middle than all the other trees other than the forbidden one.

So much more could be said about this short section, but for purposes of interpretation, hopefully I have covered enough basics that we can move on.

##### 1(Genesis).2:10-15 Branch-Rivers, Lands, Cultivate and Keep the Garden

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/10 A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was parted, and became the source of four rivers. 11 The name of the first is Pishon: it flows through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; 12 and the gold of that land is good. Bdellium‡ and onyx stone are also there. 13 The name of the second river is Gihon. It is the same river that flows through the whole land of Cush. 14 The name of the third river is Hiddekel. This is the one which flows in front of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates. 15 Yahweh God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to cultivate and keep it./</span></blockquote>

It would be worth mentioning at this point that our English style of "translating" picks an approach that, while it sounds much better and is probably on the whole better for our culture, nevertheless leaves out a lot in that it doesn't typically translate names. There is likely more data here about the pre-Flood setup of this region than we tend to think.

For example, Euphrates means fruitfulness, possibly implying people tended to prefer to live on it (more food, perhaps, if that meaning existed at the time for whatever the pre-Babel term would have been, or if it doesn't take that meaning only from the post-Flood river of which this pre-Flood one is the namesake, etc.), while Tigris means rapid, probably implying it was fast-moving.

We also lose something in that we alter even the "transliterations" of names. Tigris, for example, while it's a great-sounding word, obscures another great-sounding word which is really here, Khiddekel (Ln khiy-DEH-kehl if pronounced the way BLB says the Hebrew is, or if merely transliterating and then pronouncing it how it looks in StAE, KHIHD-(uh)-Kehl). An ideal representation of the Word of God would hopefully include all of the above, though how to do so concisely isn't so obvious, even if it were to take a highly interlinear approach.

I generally won't be commenting on this topic in the rest of this article, unless relevant to other details like when the text itself points out a play on words around the naming of a child, but it's something every reader of the Bible should be looking up for everything (eventually, not that you need any of that to know how to be saved or anything like that, but like the sense of "you must watch that movie"). I did, a long time ago, do a whole-Bible study on names, constructing my own translations of as many of them as I had time for. Eventually, Lord willing, I would like to re-do and reproduce that study in a Seek article for this site... but there are other priorities.

##### 1(Genesis).2:18-20 Helper, Formed Animals, Naming Time

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/18 Yahweh God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make him a helper comparable to§ him.” 19 Out of the ground Yahweh God formed every animal of the field, and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. Whatever the man called every living creature became its name.

20 The man gave names to all livestock, and to the birds of the sky, and to every animal of the field; but for man there was not found a helper comparable to him./</span></blockquote>

Many will form views based on eisegetically reading a meaning in to "helper" here to conclude (whether as critical skeptics or compromising Christians) that it teaches inferiority of women. As said before, to determine the meanings of the words you first need to look at other uses in the Bible, and if that were indeterminate on a question (this isn't), then look to contemporary other sources if possible, etc. The last place to look for the meaning is modern meanings of the word in a destination language of a translation in a particular culture.

As it happens, the word for helper is said often of God. Obviously God isn't inferior to humans!

An argument is made about "formed every animal" that claims this is chronological, rather than "had formed". The latter would be expected if this is Adam's account, so it's a "previously on..." kind of statement. And Hebrew grammar allows for it here.

There are also chiastic structures around Genesis 2:4. (Structures that repeat in reverse.) This is common in Hebrew prose, used as a mnemonic device. I don't think this is a good argument against a different author (Adam) for 2:5 on, but it IS a good argument that he was aware of 1-2:4, and expected the hearer (or eventually reader) of his own account to know it (or if I'm wrong about the prior sources of the toledoth sections and Moses or even any other author of Genesis wrote this newly, the same applies to whoever did).

So the Hebrew didn't need a way to indicate past-perfect (had created) -- or rather, this sort of use of context IS its way to do so.

Even today we often use just past tense when we mean past perfect. In writing in fiction, for example, if telling an extended flashback, I often begin with some past-perfect, but turn it to past later. In some contexts it even makes sense to use plain past tense, where the context makes it clear, even today.

Like if a speaker says something like, "Yesterday I thought about how amazing microwave ovens are. I used one to warm up my leftover meals. I cooked it and put it into the fridge, and now I could have it warm again without completely cooking it anew! Someone invented that!"

Obviously nobody could think the speaker means that he thought about them, then microwaved it, then he cooked it, then he put it into the fridge, then he could have it be warm again by some indeterminate means, and then someone invented some unclear thing.

Critics approach the text in a hypocritical way when they try to apply different rules, neither natural even to our own language, nor to the source language, that would force such a meaning; that's what they're doing in that bad argument.

As usual, many would try to say that forcing full formal, starchy phrasing is "better" and justify their hypocrisy by claiming it's holding God's Word to a "higher" standard, but I would suggest that method is high in a different way as it were.

Requiring God to communicate in a more boring way, overly technical, isn't better. This was especially well-known to ancients who experienced more than we do the crucial need for the reader to learn to think, not just be spoonfed everything. Failing to think could be deadly, especially in their time.

Encouraging the reader's brain to participate in the reading process is not only far more fascinating but much healthier for the reader.

Here's the chiastic structure:

First let's start with 2:4 itself, that it within itself has a chiasm:
<blockquote><span class="bbq">/4 This is the history of the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were 
created, in the day that Yahweh† God made the earth and the heavens./</span></blockquote>

LSB:

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/Gen 2:4 -
These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that [fn]Yahweh God made earth and heaven./</span></blockquote>

Structure:

[These are the generations of]
[the heavens]
[and]
[the earth]
[when they were created]
(implied: by God; passive voice)
[in the day that Yahweh God made]
[earth]
[and]
[heaven].

To be fair, the chaism breaks down a bit if we count time, creator, and creation as separate lines:

[when] (time)
[they were created]
(implied: by God; passive voice)
[in the day] (time)
[that Yahweh God]
[made]

However, the reversal of heavens/earth to earth/heavens does seem intentional, and that two phrases meaning "when God made" are between them further suggests it's intentional (a chiasm hardly needs to be completely enforced to be intentional, and of course there are other details in the surrounding passages that aren't chiastic).

And other than the time words, it's still reversing the order within these phrases; created/(by God) to Yahweh-God/made, with God implied.

I'm saying just "God" because the silence on his name here may imply a silence of deference, or various possibilities, perhaps even the Spirit's role may be emphasized there, rather than necessarily an implied reiteration of Yahweh God if that is, as I have said that I suspect and shown why, the Personal designation here for the pre-Incarnate Christ. All three of these Persons are God, and the first phrase may imply that as well; the Being of God.

Around it, we have some points that make a loose match to a chiasm, although it shouldn't be overstated since, again, other details don't fit into one:

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/1
1 In the beginning, God† created the heavens and the earth. 2 The earth was formless and empty. Darkness was on the surface of the deep and God’s Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters.
3 God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 4 God saw the light, and saw that it was good. God divided the light from the darkness. 5 God called the light “day”, and the darkness he called “night”. There was evening and there was morning, the first day.
6 God said, “Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.” 7 God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so. 8 God called the expanse “sky”. There was evening and there was morning, a second day.
9 God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place, and <b>let the dry land appear;” and it was so. 10 God called the dry land “earth”,</b> and the gathering together of the waters he called “seas”. God saw that it was good. 11 <b>God said, “Let the earth yield grass, herbs yielding seeds, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with their seeds in it, on the earth;” and it was so. 12 The earth yielded grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with their seeds in it, after their kind;</b> and God saw that it was good. 13 There was evening and there was morning, a third day.
14 God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs to mark seasons, days, and years; 15 and let them be for lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth;” and it was so. 16 God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He also made the stars. 17 God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light to the earth, 18 and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. God saw that it was good. 19 There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.
20 God said, “Let the waters abound with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the sky.” 21 God created the large sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind. God saw that it was good. 22 God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.” 23 There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.
24 God said, “Let the earth produce living creatures after their kind, livestock, creeping things, and animals of the earth after their kind;” and it was so. 25 God made the animals of the earth after their kind, and the livestock after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind. God saw that it was good.
26 God said, <b>“Let’s make man in our image, after our likeness. Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the sky, and over the livestock, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.” 27 God created man in his own image. In God’s image he created him; male and female he created them.</b> 28 God blessed them. God said to them, “Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the sky, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.” 29 God said, “Behold,‡ I have given you every <b>herb yielding seed, which is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree, which bears fruit yielding seed. It will be your food. 30 To every animal of the earth, and to every bird of the sky, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food;”</b> and it was so.
31 God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. There was evening and there was morning, a sixth day.
2
1 The heavens, the earth, and all their vast array were finished. 2 On the seventh day God finished his work which he had done; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done. 3 God blessed the seventh day, and made it holy, because he rested in it from all his work of creation which he had done.

4 <b>This is the history of the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were 
created, in the day that Yahweh† God made the earth and the heavens.</b>

5 No <b>plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up;</b> for Yahweh God had not caused it to rain on the earth. <b>There was not a man to till the ground,</b> 6 but a mist went up from the earth, and watered the whole surface of the ground. 7 <b>Yahweh God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</b> 8 <b>Yahweh God planted a garden eastward, in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had formed. 9 Out of the ground Yahweh God made every tree to grow that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food, including the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</b> 10 A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was parted, and became the source of four rivers. 11 The name of the first is Pishon: it flows through the whole <b>land</b> of Havilah, where there is gold; 12 and the gold of that <b>land</b> is good. Bdellium‡ and onyx stone are also there. 13 The name of the second river is Gihon. It is the same river that flows through the whole <b>land</b> of Cush. 14 The name of the third river is Hiddekel. This is the one which flows in front of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates. 15 Yahweh God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to cultivate and keep it. 16 Yahweh God commanded the man, saying, “You may freely eat of every tree of the garden; 17 but you shall not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; for in the day that you eat of it, you will surely die.”
18 Yahweh God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make him a helper comparable to§ him.” 19 Out of the ground Yahweh God formed every animal of the field, and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. Whatever the man called every living creature became its name. 20 The man gave names to all livestock, and to the birds of the sky, and to every animal of the field; but for man there was not found a helper comparable to him. 21 Yahweh God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep. As the man slept, he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place. 22 Yahweh God made a woman from the rib which he had taken from the man, and brought her to the man. 23 The man said, “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She will be called ‘woman,’ because she was taken out of Man.” 24 Therefore a man will leave his father and his mother, and will join with his wife, and they will be one flesh. 25 The man and his wife were both naked, and they were not ashamed./</span></blockquote>

It appears that the author of 2:5 on (or, the author of 2:4 on if I'm wrong about Sig-After-Until-Abe, or, the author of all of this if I'm wrong about signatures entirely) has picked out a pattern of the opening section of the second account (what I think is Adam's account), and structured it in a way that mirrors some of the focus on man and plants before, likely only focusing on those because they were the focus of this author for this section.

Then after this introduction gets to the land bookend of the mirror pattern, the chiasm is abandoned, for a detailed Adam-POV account of Day 6. Here the mention of animals being created is said again because that also happened on Day 6.

So in short, the author first tells you that he was well aware of the order of events in 1-2:3 (or as I think, 1-2:4), then now that you know you should read things like the mention of animals in 2:19 as past-perfect (had formed), (and the creation of plants, which might be implied in 2:9 if it doesn't mean only in the Garden in that case), he is free to simply elaborate on Day 6 in more detail, in order.

The order of the chiasm we get out of that, to summarize, was:

[land]
[plants]
[human(s)]
[plants]
[toledoth line]
[plants]
[human]
[plants]
[land]

This would fit well with 2:5+ being Adam; noticing the obvious chiasm in 2:4, the signature line that Jesus authored 1-2:4, and inspired by its chiasm, phrased the introduction to his account in a chiastic way with 1-2:3.

Finally, another bad argument often used is that Adam could not have named all the animals in this time.

However, notice that it says he was only brought a subset of all animals; only the ones of the field (as in livestock), and birds (flying creatures). And of course, this is only baramin (created kinds), not modern branch-kinds (such as species).

Based on the number of types of animals we know, naming ALL land animals in this span would not have been problematic anyways, nor even to have all the macroscopic animals including sea creatures (presumably other than any that can only survive in the deep ocean, though God could have done that miraculously as well). If we pretend he had to take an hour of indecision to name every one, it wouldn't work, but it's pure eisegesis to read that in. I don't think he had to name sea creatures or all land creatures, but the point is it would hardly take him a long time.

Especially prior to the effects of sin. Even today, we can often intuitively name things in an instant, and since some people today have photographic memories, and Adam surely would have had this and would likely have been able to intuitively name things every time, not just the occasional times we today can only do, surely there would be no problem here, even without the stated limits on which types.

Note the next verse reiterates these things, though it does clarify that livestock are not necessarily the only creatures of the field included. (See below for it repeated.)

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/20 The man gave names to all livestock, and to the birds of the sky, and to every animal of the field; but for man there was not found a helper comparable to him./</span></blockquote>

##### 1(Genesis).2:23-24 Creation Therefore

I here skip the rib incident since this article isn't meant to be an entire commentary, and interpretation questions can apply to literally every verse of the Bible; I have to draw the line somewhere. Suffice to say read CMI, AiG on this.

Continuing to look more for major interpretatation implications, I start next in 23-24:

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/23 The man said, “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She will be called ‘woman,’ because she was taken out of Man.” 24 Therefore a man will leave his father and his mother, and will join with his wife, and they will be one flesh./</span></blockquote>

The key here being the Therefore.

This would help explain why Jesus took the original pattern of events as intended as instructive, not merely descriptive.

This makes sense, because God didn't HAVE to create in this format, taking a day of a week, creating Eve out of Adam's flesh, etc. He clearly did these things with a teaching purpose.

##### 1(Genesis).3:1-4 Interpreting God's Command

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/1 Now the serpent was more subtle than any animal of the field which Yahweh God had made. He said to the woman, “Has God really said, ‘You shall not eat of any tree of the garden’?”
2 The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees of the garden, 3 but not the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden. God has said, ‘You shall not eat of it. You shall not touch it, lest you die.’ ”
4 The serpent said to the woman, “You won’t really die, 5 for God knows that in the day you eat it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”/</span></blockquote>

Many people focus here on whether Eve made something up. We don't know that; God may have said more than was recorded. Keep in mind the norm in ancient times was selection from what was said (and paraphrase).

To ignore this and go on to build a whole system based on assuming Eve sinned here already by adding to what God said is itself adding to what God said, rather than cautious exegesis, and may give Satan and others with ill intent (maybe including yourself) illicit room to go against God's intended meaning. Do not go beyond what is written.

That doesn't mean you can't conclude things soundly from it; we'll see over and over in the gospels that Jesus, to the contrary, acts shocked when we fail to do so.

But it has to be sound, not an argument from silence, or an anachronism of a cultural idea of "if it had been said, it would have been quoted" (especially since all of these are very short accounts in Genesis 1-11 which may be due to limited space for recording, or if only oral originally, to keep the task of memorization highly reliable).

Of course, Satan's setup and reply isn't even about interpretation but just baldly accusing God of lying. (I guess you could say that means reinterpreting God's intent as a lie. Or maybe he meant only as a riddle, but in any case, clearly this was wrong, intentionally so.)

About what the serpent was, we have a lot of data, but again, trying not to make this page a whole-Bible commentary in general. I'll undoubtedly have other articles on that, God willing for the time it takes.

##### 1(Genesis).3:8 Heard God's Voice Walking

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/8 They heard Yahweh God’s voice walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden./</span></blockquote>

I heard someone, who has on many occasions demonstrated a good understanding of source grammars and looks at scholars, Anthony Rogers, though I don't know if he's correct, say this "Voice" is an allusion to the Word, as in that this is the title of this manifestion of God, and of the Person it represents, the pre-Incarnate Christ.

WEBP here earns its keep, if this is true; it actually shows that it would seem to mean that; hearing the voice walking, not what many other translations do, perhaps out of innocently failing to connect the dots and trying to clear up their own confusion (assuming the grammar doesn't actually indicate what they change it to), and say things like here in NIV:

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the LORD God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the LORD God among the trees of the garden./</span></blockquote>

Even LSB here obscures it:

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/Then they heard the sound of Yahweh God walking in the garden in the [fn]cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God in the midst of the trees of the garden./</span></blockquote>

Though that's partly because LSB strives to preserve the word order, and that actually is the word order (sound of LORD God means the same as LORD God's sound), but it makes "sound" generalized so it could be the sound of footsteps/etc. rather than voice. This would fit with verse 10, though it could also of course be that God simply is calling out already asking where they are at that point, as we'll see said that he did shortly.

Note: "of" is added by LSB, although in this case they don't put it in italics to indicate a word only implied by the original and not stated, presumably because it's such a basic of grammar. To fit normal English grammar and preserve the word order, "of" does need to be added. But this still makes it clear that it's the "sound" word that what was walking. There is nothing in the Hebrew to indicate other than word order that this means sound/voice [of] God, though voice/sound itself does have a direct-object marker in front of it, meaning the voice (or sound) is also what was heard.

And a look at other meanings shows this to be ambiguous; the word can indeed mean both voice and sound in general.

This looks like a good example at least of how the data can seem to support one interpretation, while a look at wider data can make it look like another is the more correct.

This encourages thought, attentiveness, and further reading, making God's Word well-designed.

It does mean you need to treat your own interpretations (and that of others, even if the most popular readings, even those favored perhaps by scholars, who from time to time change the majority view on various things) with humility and caution.

(And I'm not sure which interpretation of that is right. Rogers may know of some point I'm unaware of (or have forgotten if I had seen him raise it before) that favors the Voice as a title interpretation. In any case, we did already have evidence that John didn't get the Word idea merely from later extrabiblical ideas like a common source of Philo's Logos, but that these are likely rooted in God speaking the orders in Genesis 1. So we wouldn't need this to be Voice as a title for John to have seen that.)

##### 1(Genesis).3:9-15 Rhetorical Ignorance, and He and then He

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/9 Yahweh God called to the man, and said to him, “Where are you?”
10 The man said, “I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; so I hid myself.”
11 God said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?”
12 The man said, “The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate it.”
13 Yahweh God said to the woman, “What have you done?”
The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”
14 Yahweh God said to the serpent,
“Because you have done this,
you are cursed above all livestock,
and above every animal of the field.
You shall go on your belly
and you shall eat dust all the days of your life.
15 I will put hostility between you and the woman,
and between your offspring and her offspring.
He will bruise your head,
and you will bruise his heel.”/</span></blockquote>

Here what I'm focusing on are just two aspects, at least for now.

First, the rhetorical ignorance. God can ask where, while actually knowing where. This can be seen in that after the initial conversation, God foreknows even the future!

Note that of course it's easily possible that the Son's manifestation here simply wasn't accessing that knowledge in his infinite, omniscient divine Person (much the same as how it worked during the Incarnation) within the "onboard" mind of this theophany, that the Father wasn't communicating it to the theophany either, nor the Spirit. (Without the theophany needing to be a different person from the Son's Person. Just a representation of, like an avatar of, his infinite divine Personhood.)

In Genesis 4 we'll see an even more obvious case of rhetorical ignorance.

Second, a clear proof here that pronouns in Hebrew do not need to only reference the previous noun. WEBP obscures this a bit, but LSB here is:

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/Gen 3:9 - Yahweh God called to the man and said to him, “Where are you?”

10 - And he said, “I heard the sound of You in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid.”

11 - And He said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?”/</span></blockquote>

I haven't seen very many things made of this, but some "fundy atheist" groups do make much of ONE use of it, when Moses was told to write other things God said while God was writing the second copy of the Ten Commandments after Moses broke the first one.

The wacko named Dan Barker, also called (for making this mistake), the Mad Barker, of the persecution group known as the Freedom From Freedom Foundation (FFFF) (they call themselves Freedom From Religion Foundation; FFRF), based an argument on a use of "he" there after "Moses" to claim that the "real" ten commandments are the things God was telling Moses while God was (in reality) writing the 10Cs.

Barker would have noticed that had he read the whole section, which starts off with GOD saying that he would write the 10Cs, so clearly the other thing that Moses was separately to write wasn't the 10Cs. But don't expect a harsh type like Barker to understand the need for cautious checking of context.

Many others have uncritically parroted this in an attempt to mock it, especially for my favorite law in it, don't boil a young goat in its mother's milk.

Most likely these are applications, since they do roughly correspond to the order of the 10Cs, using examples from their time (such as that pagan practice about the milk, it's thought). (Also there are more commands in it than just ten, a point also lost on Barker.) In any case, clearly the 10Cs are the ones in Exodus 20.

Many, many other examples of pronouns clearly not referring to the most-recently-used noun can be seen. Now that I know to look for it I notice this all the time; clearly the unthoughtful skeptics wanted instead to leap to a conclusion, and leap to the attack. This is just one of the first ones in the text that I had noticed, in the normal biblical reading order.
