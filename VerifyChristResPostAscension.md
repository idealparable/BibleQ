# Verifying Christ's Resurrection Post-Ascension (Then and Now)

**Bible Question:** Could people of the time still verify Christ's resurrection after he had ascended? Can we today? If yes, how?

This is a summary of how society at the time worked, and some (often-overlooked) aspects of why we today can have a higher degree of confidence on just these points alone than you might initially think if you don't know how their society worked, related to this question.

It's a save (on my part) and paraphrase of others involved in a conversation elsewhere, reformatted to an article format.

# Answer
Yes, they could, due to how a collectivist society worked, and the rules for a proper ancient historian, which we know Luke followed.

For us today, we have many others lines of support beyond this, so we don't really need to rely only on this. Whether it by itself would be sufficient is thus a moot point I'm less interested in. But it's certainly strong enough that it forms a major part of the support, among many other major supports.

In what follows, I will specify when the speaker was me, and directly quote me (possibly with some alteration for this article version) in those cases.

I'll specify whether others in the conversation were the main non-believer who brought it up, which I'll label as questioner, but I won't be directly quoting the questioner since this is more about the common question, not the specific wording, except the use of "verifying" that is explained in my own response.

I'll do the same for other Christians in the conversation.

Questioner: After Jesus ascended, is it too late for people of the time to verify he had been raised from the dead? Since they can't then empirically check (can't just go see him alive)?

Christian answers: No.

Another Christian clarifies that the topic before was about us today deciding our priority of what claims of miracles to start with, and we as Christians admit that a skeptic probably shouldn't start with ones where the report comes from someone very distant in time and/or location from where the miracle is claimed to have happened.

We would say instead start with those that are closest.

Additions of the past context for this article (not stated in the conversation elsewhere):

It's thought that creeds and even epistles were going out extremely early, in ancient terms essentially instantly, about both Christ's public-witnessed death and his resurrection appearances to 500+ people.

Many people there who lived in and around Jerusalem and were still there for the Passover would have been right in the epicenter of this event.

Others would have access to these witnesses' reports from all over the globe as Jews who had pilgrimed to Jerusalem for the feast return home, throughout Judea, Galilee, Palestine in general, the near-east, the Roman Empire, and possibly some cases even beyond it to some extent.

Later evangelists, which could include witnesses and those who heard from them early, would also go out.

They would be forming mnemonic creeds and summaries of what was witnessed to ensure it wasn't forgotten, even before it was written down.

Plus it's thought that several of Paul's epistles went out very early too.

And we have strong evidence that Matthew and John wrote their gospels, as eyewitnesses, and they exhibit many reliable patterns of honest witnesses, and that Mark studied from Peter and so the same is only one step removed in his case.

But what about Luke and others who then hear from these sources? Is it too late for them to justifiably reach a certain conclusion?

The answer is no -- and that extends to us today. The conversation will continue below, with more about why.

Questioner conceded the basic point, that the criterion for our priority of investigation today is meant to lessen the risk of "faulty memories, legendary development, and... distance from the event", and that "a few weeks doesn't do it" (quoting that from the previous Christian).

But the questioner thinks that he has a different point (not yet understanding why this isn't really a different topic).

Questioner specifically says that "waiting" until after anyone can verify it is a "red flag" for him.

This piqued my interest, because nobody had claimed it was too late to verify it at that point; in fact, the topic WAS that it wasn't too late!

I decided to step in then and question the questioner and see where it might lead. I guessed it would go to a common modern misconception (as it did) based on conflating modern society with ancient ones and thus thinking the only reliable way is direct empirical seeing of Jesus alive after.

(This is already conceding, though, presumably, that we trust the word of those who say they saw him publicly executed, stabbed in the heart, etc. So it's already a bit inconsistent, but the topic came up due to Hume's famous dispensing with anything miraculous, so this would be the more "extraordinary claim" to use the other popular argument on this that was also brought up by the Christians earlier, so the skeptic would use these to try to justify the inconsistency.)

Me: "Who told you it was too late to verify it? It wasn't."

Questioner: Jesus had ascended.

(He had verified now that he meant what I thought he meant, basically a Doubting Thomas error. I decided to not just dump the whole explanation on him yet and see if he could articulate why this is definitely too late.)

Me: "And that means it can't be verified why?"

Up to now, the questioner had acted like he already had done his research and analysis and knew that it couldn't be verified.

I phrased it this way to give him the benefit of the doubt in case he hadn't, and to clue him in that normal people wouldn't think that, especially not those who DID do the research, as I had. He likely would be shocked that anybody would think his idea is odd.

Of course, I knew skeptics usually claim certainty without the work to justify it, and leap to conclusions, so I wasn't surprised when he flipped his approach instead to admitting ignorance.

Questioner: How would you verify a raising from death if you can't go see them in-person alive or find any trace that they had been alive later?

(Trace was his word, the rest is clarified paraphrase.)

The rest below after where I mark it as "Me:" is my response, for now final; we'll see if he says anything worth noting later. This was an experimental approach to see what might be going on his head, so it's hard to predict what he'll say. Most skeptics just recognize the logic, and retreat to stubbornness, but this one did concede some things earlier so we'll see if he's more reasonable.

I would expect, based on past trends, some things about reliable memory, possibly (see JP Holding on "daguerrotype" memory for debunking of common skeptic claims on this), "hearsay" and unreliability of witness reports perhaps (though it seems he has already mostly conceded this -- see JPH also on those), or maybe if he's smart enough to think of it, doubting that experiential but inexpert body language understanding could have been good enough for the people of the time.

I didn't get into any of that, but on the body language point, my experience is that while many things would likely fly over their heads, some things are pretty reliable and intuitively sensed, and I know that body language experts have said that this can happen to some extent, especially for women, which is interesting given the prominent role of women in these historical claims about Jesus' resurrection. I've noticed similar reliable trends even about word choice that can be seen in text too.

Since the rest for me is just me, I'll drop the quote marks; if I add more later it will be made clear that's what I'm doing.

Me: You know this is a collectivist society, right? And what that means?

I'm just going by what you said -- "verifying" -- not only specifically verifying by sight only of them alive for example.

You just said verifying in-general, so any other conclusive evidence that is highly unlikely to go with a mere false rumor counts as verifying beyond reasonable doubt.

Firstly it's nearly moot anyways that it would ever take more than seven weeks in this kind of society.

[Clarification for the article: That is, for Jerusalem, Judea, and possibly Palestine in general to an extent; obviously it does take more time for more distant locations.]

Read JP Holding on this and his recommended social science book sources.

In short, everybody essentially gossips about everything and knows all about everybody all the time, almost instantly.

They would be familiar with patterns of word that goes out reliably versus false rumors because false rumors (at least of highly public events like the crucifixion and appearance to 500+ at once alive later) would not produce reliable large numbers of witnesses saying the same truths but not in rehearsed, aligned "figure out what we should say" wordings and the like, freely without signs of deceptive body language (that they would intuitively be familiar with from testing it constantly in their lives) offering new details if asked.

This would be easy to verify within a few generations.

Obviously not as good as seeing him dead then seeing him alive yourself, but again, you just said "verify" without specifying only that type. And since it's reliable, it's enough.

This is why Paul mentioned about many of them being alive.

[Addition for article, let's quote it, with the full context which is also closely the subject:

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/[1Co 15:1-11 LSB] 1 Now I make known to you, brothers, the gospel which I proclaimed as good news to you, which also you received, in which also you stand,<br><br>

2 by which also you are saved, if you hold fast the word which I proclaimed to you as good news, unless you believed for nothing.<br><br>

3 For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,<br><br>

4 and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,<br><br>

5 and that He appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.<br><br>

6 <b>After that He appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom remain until now</b>, but some have fallen asleep.<br><br>

7 After that, He appeared to James, then to all the apostles,<br><br>

8 and last of all, as to one untimely born, He appeared to me also.<br><br>

9 For I am the least of the apostles, and not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.<br><br>

10 But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me did not prove vain; but I labored even more than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God with me.<br><br>

11 Whether then [it was] I or they, so we preach and so you believed./</span></blockquote>

]

The point was people would be asking. They would be doing this well before 7 weeks, but if someone had been traveling and returned, they would come upon a landscape of the social effects that only fits a highly confirmed fact, not a false rumor, and they would be able to tell.

They would (rightly) see this as verifying.

Also this sort of process was done by historians; read Glenn Miller on this, the Glenn Miller often cited by JP Holding on his place-on-the-globe-spanning-weblike-thingy.

Luke specifically is known to have done this.

(So even we can verify it today, though obviously it's best that we have, as we do, other lines of further support beyond just seeing that Luke passes the tests of a reliable historian, but this adds to the verification that stands for all time including for us today.)

Example of the differences:

TRUE PUBLIC EVENT: the gossiper says X happened, you ask who the witnesses were, they either name them or name who they heard it from and you go ask them and as you continue to ask around, you get consistent ends of the pathways of who heard from who in a large number of witnesses (depending on how public it is), and you see these features when you question any still-surviving witnesses.

FALSE EVENT: The gossipers won't say who the witnesses are, or rarely do, and if they do say, the witnesses can't agree. (We see this problem even mentioned in the gospels; the accusers at Jesus' trial tried this, but even they couldn't get the supposed witnesses to agree to the accusers' own satisfaction.)

Since they all talk about all all the time, they could hardly help but notice these two patterns, and that if the true one is testable more directly later too, empirically, it will always align with the pattern described above for a true public event.

Of course this isn't saying the public will NEVER get such things wrong, or that there would be no people who don't end up agreeing with it; it depends on which ones want the truth versus which ones (like the accusers themselves after the claims were going around of the resurrection who don't want to believe they crucified the Christ) don't dare to investigate.

Also those who bow to fear of such authorities, etc. But for those who did care and took the risk, they absolutely could verify it.

Also note you flipped your logic.

It was originally that you knew it couldn't be verified, so you would have to be able to answer me by explaining WHY it's definitely too late, so you should have explained why only directly seeing Jesus alive counts as verifying to any reliable extent.

Instead you then just acted surprised, as I expected, that there might be any other methods and admitted you don't know them.

But to know that it was too late earlier, you would have had to have already done your homework on this topic, so you should already be familiar with this and have already talked about it before I brought it up.

But since you hadn't, you couldn't yet conclude it was too late in the first place. You put your conclusion before your research. Bad idea.

But it's normal -- it happens because our modern society has changed a lot, due to modern tech, so you naturally assume (bad, but understandable people will do that) that ancient societies worked similarly enough, and you don't think through the effects of NOT having our modern tech as much as you should, though it might feel to you like you did.

It makes us much more individualistic and we live much more isolated lives and often physically more distant, so we typically have less witnesses of events in the first place, and a method not used will atrophy -- since we are accustomed to having things like cameras to record events, instant global reports, etc. our skills for discerning reliable word-of-mouth reports have atrophied.

So we notice that when tested, more often even fairly close word of mouth reports are either just "I dunno what you're asking about; I didn't see it" or wild speculation, and you naturally project that onto ancients, conflating our trends with theirs. Not how it works.

Of course there was SOME risk of such things, but it was a lot less in their society.

In effect, that is a highly reliable "trace".
