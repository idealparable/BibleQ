# Lingua - Keyboard Typeable Pronunciation System

Lingua could also be called SoundType. It's a subset of my [Cipher](Cipher){:target="_blank"} language systems.

## Rules of Lingua
1. **Single apostrophe (') is a silent separator of sounds**. It *must be used when two letters would otherwise be part of combination spellings not intended*. It is *not* a syllable separator.
  
    In "Lingua proper" (where the goal is to communicate the pronunciation), this is all apostrophe can imply. This should be indicated by all-capitalizing syllables with emphasis. If the word is one-syllable, you can all-cap the entire word.

    If you want to make a normal spelling such as a transliteration that's inspired by Lingua but doesn't strictly follow its rules, you could use single apostrophe to imply a schwa character, if it still looks clear to you on a case by case basis what was intended.

    Optionally you can show single apostrophes between all sounds or any you like if it looks good.

2. **Dash is a syllable separator**. It *must be used when it would otherwise be unclear which sound goes in which syllable*.
