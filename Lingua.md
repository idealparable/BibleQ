# Lingua - Keyboard Typeable Pronunciation System

Lingua could also be called SoundType. It's a subset of my [Cipher](Cipher){:target="_blank"} language systems.

## Rules of Lingua
1. **Single apostrophe (') is a silent separator of sounds**. It *must be used when two letters would otherwise be part of combination spellings not intended*. It is *not* a syllable separator.
  
    In "Lingua proper" (where the goal is to communicate the pronunciation), this is all apostrophe can imply. This should be indicated by all-capitalizing syllables with emphasis. If the word is one-syllable, you can all-cap the entire word.

    If you want to make a normal spelling such as a transliteration that's inspired by Lingua but doesn't strictly follow its rules, you could use single apostrophe "as" a schwa character, if it still looks clear to you on a case by case basis what was intended. But this would really be a schwa followed by an apostrophe, and then the schwa is just removed and implied.

    Optionally you can show single apostrophes between all sounds or any you like if it looks good.

    Silent separators can separate any type of sound -- whether consonant or vowel, or vowel from consonant. Some sounds have their own rules for how the separator is recommended to be used; this will be specified in their entries.

2. **Dash is a syllable separator**. It *must be used when it would otherwise be unclear which sound goes in which syllable*. Optionally can be between all syllables.

3. *Syllable emphasis system:*
  A. Syllables with **full emphasis** are **all-capitalized** / all uppercase (like "**THIS**").
  B. Syllables with no emphasis are *all* **un***capitalized* / all lowercase (like "**this**").
  C. Syllables with partial emphasis are *first-letter-capitalized (like "**This**").

  D. **If a syllable has either full or partial emphasis, it must be two-letters long**. Syllables always have vowels, and while five vowels have optional one-letter versions, they could only be used (in proper full version of Lingua) in the two-letter versions, if there is no consonant represented (other than a silent one used within the vowel combo such as the silent H in "oh").

  E. **If** you're representing a pronunciation guide someone else made and **you don't know whether unstressed (syllables not marked as with emphasis) should be full emphasis, no emphasis, or partial, default to partial if there's one other (no-emphasis) syllable between it**.

    Example, the word "syllable" itself has the first syllable emphasized in English, fully, and the third partially. If you didn't know that and you only knew the first syllable was emphasized, default the third to partial. (This rule had to be added because BLB often has this problem.) So it would look like SIHL-^-B^l.

4. When giving a pronunciation guide, it's probably best, depending on the situation, to show multiple versions of the pronunciation, separated by slashes, the first version including all the optional clarifiers like dashes and the full versions of each vowel sound, then the next ones showing whichever steps of condensing make the most sense to you, all with the syllable emphasis included. (If it's one syllable, all-capitalize it.)

    Then for the final one you can drop the syllable emphasis, either first-letter-capitalizing if it's a name, or not capitalizing it, for the most condensed transliteration you suggest that will look "cleanest" / simplest in normal usage (but might not be proper Lingua per se).

5. **Every spelling** (when the above rules are followed) **has only one sound**. Keep in mind though that this can only depict an approximate pronunciation and only *for one dialect/accent at a time*.

    My convention is that for English, I default to Standard American English (StAE) dialect in pronunciation guides, and for Greek and Hebrew, I default to a list I came up with, not necessarily a "theory" of what the ancient pronunciations were, but based on what some webpage results claimed were the common ancient pronunciations (of course, that probably varied).

    None of these would be meant to dictate the only valid pronunciation, but serve as a starting point.
    
    Those of other dialects who know which sounds in theirs go with which sounds in StAE, for example, can pronounce their way, but if they spell it, they should probably indicate it by spelling it in Lingua (if I have provided options for it; I might not have covered every important nuance -- I was focused just on English, "ancient" Hebrew, and "ancient" Greek) and stating somewhere which dialect it is. (Likewise I try to always clarify which dialect I'm using, as I am here on this page.)

    Please don't actually think of the spellings as belonging to different sounds. It you "translate" the sound in your mind, keep the StAE dialect sound in mind primarily, and imagine (or try to) how it would look spelled in your dialect.

NOTE: Lingua is not ideal for portraying tones concisely. For hand-drawing, Syllabic / SoundGlyphs does have an optional version that can portray tones efficiently, such as for Mandarin.

For Lingua, you first need to know the symbols for high to lower tones.

Heights of tones are not easy to represent using keyboard symbols, when many others are taken (for example "^" is taken for schwa, dash ("-") is taken as a syllable separator). You simply have to memorize the following list which goes from high tone to low. I'll depict them on a single line so you can compare the height difference.

`+=~_

You can think of equals sign as "equally high and low" -- a middle pitch, and plus as adding a little to that for mid-low, while grave accent (typed with the button on a normal keyboard to the left of 1) is highest. Obviously underscore is lowest, and that leaves tilde as mid-low.

Then you need to understand how to indicate length of a tone. This is done using one of these symbols, after the pitch indicator, shown in order from shortest to longest.

,. (, = short, . = medium)

Syllables default to the medium length, so the period can normally be left off.

To indicate a mid-tone short syllable (Mandarin Neutral Tone), use:

;

Representing short (the comma part) and mid-tone (the higher dot).

For mid-tone normal medium length, use:

:

Using the same logic.

Otherwise, the length indicator needs to go after the pitch indicator, and to indicate longer tones, use two, three, or more periods, similar to an ellipsis.

So, examples of length in ascending order:

,
.
..
...
....

And so on.

If your tone falls from or to any of the three middle ranges, you just have to show the pitch indicators in order from start to end.

Otherwise if it rises or falls from the highest to lowest pitch, or vice versa, you may use slashes and backslashes:

/ (lowest to highest)

\ (highest to lowest)

Remember if you add more pitch indicators, it has no effect on the length of the tone. So a more complex tone with many pitch indicators needs to be pronounced quickly to fit in the same amount of time as one with just one pitch indicator, if no length indicator is included (which means default "." length).

Examples using Mandarin tones:

- Mandarin First Tone (constant high level): Two grave accents (` -- the symbol typed with the button on normal keyboards to the left of the 1 key) before and after the syllable.
    
    Example: ma`

- Mandarin Second Tone (rising):
