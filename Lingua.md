# Lingua - Keyboard Typeable Pronunciation System

Lingua could also be called SoundType. It's a subset of my [Cipher](Cipher){:target="_blank"} language systems.

Lingua can be abbreviated "Ln" (see Cipher page for abbreviations of Cipher and related systems).

## Rules of Lingua
1. **Single apostrophe (') is a silent separator of sounds**. It *must be used when two letters would otherwise be part of combination spellings not intended*. It is *not* a syllable separator.
  
    In "Lingua proper" (where the goal is to communicate the pronunciation), this is all apostrophe can imply. This should be indicated by all-capitalizing syllables with emphasis. If the word is one-syllable, you can all-cap the entire word.

    If you want to make a normal spelling such as a transliteration that's inspired by Lingua but doesn't strictly follow its rules, you could use single apostrophe "as" a schwa character, if it still looks clear to you on a case by case basis what was intended. But this would really be a schwa followed by an apostrophe, and then the schwa is just removed and implied. I prefer to then drop the syllable-emphasis indications to help make it clear it isn't a "proper" pronunication-guide spelling anymore in that case or similar cases.

    Optionally you can show single apostrophes between all sounds or any you like if it looks good.

    Silent separators can separate any type of sound -- whether consonant or vowel, or vowel from consonant. Some sounds have their own rules for how the separator is recommended to be used; this will be specified in their entries.

    My convention is also to prefer to keep the apostrophe whenever the spelling would otherwise look too much like a recognizeable word or part of a word pronounced a different way in English.

2. **Dash is a syllable separator**. It *must be used when it would otherwise be unclear which sound goes in which syllable*. Optionally can be between all syllables.

3. *Syllable emphasis system:*

    A. Syllables with **full emphasis** are **all-capitalized** / all uppercase (like "**THIS**").

    B. Syllables with no emphasis are *all* **un***capitalized* / all lowercase (like "**this**").
  
    C. Syllables with partial emphasis are <i><b>first-letter</b>-capitalized</i> (like "**This**").

    D. **If a syllable has either full or partial emphasis, it must be two-letters long**. Syllables always have vowels (in "Lingua proper"), and while five vowels have optional one-letter versions, they could only be used (in proper full version of Lingua) in the two-letter versions for full/partial emphasis, if there is no consonant represented (other than a silent one used within the vowel combo such as the silent H in "oh").

    This is so you can tell the difference between both letters capitalized (full emphasis) and first-letter capitalized (partial).

    E. **If** you're representing a pronunciation guide someone else made and **you don't know whether unstressed (syllables not marked as with emphasis) should be full emphasis, no emphasis, or partial, default to partial if there's one other (no-emphasis) syllable between it**.

    Example, the word "syllable" itself has the first syllable emphasized in English, fully, and the third partially. If you didn't know that and you only knew the first syllable was emphasized, default the third to partial. (This rule had to be added because BLB often has this problem.) So it would look like SIHL-^-B^l.

4. When giving a pronunciation guide, it's probably best, depending on the situation, to show multiple versions of the pronunciation, separated by slashes, the first version including all the optional clarifiers like dashes and the full versions of each vowel sound, then the next ones showing whichever steps of condensing make the most sense to you, all with the syllable emphasis included. (If it's one syllable, all-capitalize it.)

    Then for the final one you can drop the syllable emphasis, either first-letter-capitalizing if it's a name, or not capitalizing it, for the most condensed transliteration you suggest that will look "cleanest" / simplest in normal usage (but might not be proper Lingua per se).

5. **Every spelling** (when the above rules are followed) **has only one sound**. Keep in mind though that this can only depict an approximate pronunciation and only *for one dialect/accent at a time*.

    My convention is that for English, I default to Standard American English (StAE) dialect in pronunciation guides, and for Greek and Hebrew, I default to a list I came up with, not necessarily a "theory" of what the ancient pronunciations were, but based on what some webpage results claimed were the common ancient pronunciations (of course, that probably varied).

    None of these would be meant to dictate the only valid pronunciation, but serve as a starting point.
    
    Those of other dialects who know which sounds in theirs go with which sounds in StAE, for example, can pronounce their way, but if they spell it, they should probably indicate it by spelling it in Lingua (if I have provided options for it; I might not have covered every important nuance -- I was focused just on English, "ancient" Hebrew, and "ancient" Greek) and stating somewhere which dialect it is. (Likewise I try to always clarify which dialect I'm using, as I am here on this page.)

    Please don't actually think of the spellings as belonging to different sounds. It you "translate" the sound in your mind, keep the StAE dialect sound in mind primarily, and imagine (or try to) how it would look spelled in your dialect.

6. Parentheses are used to indicate either the optional long spelling of schwa (short relative of UH) Ln "(UH)" / "(uh)" / "^" or for other spellings besides "uh" indicate a similarly short version of the sound (even though the addition of the parentheses makes the spelling actually longer).

    To indicate a shortened actual  "UH" sound (which is distinct from schwa; compare UH in "heart" versus schwa in "hurt"), you would need to borrow the comma from Lingua's [Tones](#tones) system ("uh,"), or you could enclose the "uh" in single-quotes (apostrophes as silent sound separators), to indicate that the parentheses are not part of the sound's spelling itself (they are with schwa).

    Parentheses are used for this since although schwa is normally always in unstressed syllables, that isn't the case with the consonants R and L (and some similar variants), as in the example "hurry" (En/English spelling); Ln H(UH)R-ree.

    That would be the "proper" longest/clearest spelling. If you want to condense, you can just use ^ in cases like that since the presence of the R will clarify that it's meant to be all-capitalized; Ln H^R-ree. But technically "^" is only lowercase (no emphasis).

7. You can use curly brackets ("{}") to indicate a non-"proper" transliteration based on Lingua, as long as it's clear it is Lingua. (I have suggested curly brackets as an optional alternative unrelated to Lingua for indicating an extrabiblical quote as opposed to pipe (\|) characters which I prefer.)

  You can do that by just include "Ln" right before it (as long as you've explained somewhere what that means).

  My convention is to put the clearest (to English speakers at least) version of a Lingua-based transliteration at the very end of a list of slashed alternatives, and to put less-recommended ones in curly brackets, but not to use them for the final "recommended" spelling (and rely instead on the lack of any all-capitalized syllables to indicate a non-proper form).


### Conventions for Lingua Definitions
These are explanations of how and why I'll format the definitions below of each Lingua sound, applying to both Consonants and Vowels.

My convention is to show the sounds in almost all lowercase form, when introducing them, and later I can show them all-capitalized when using them in a sentence as the sound by itself, but to default to lowercase in one-syllable pronunciation guides of words/etc.

Example:

"zh = as in a<b>z</b>ure, mira<b>g</b>e

ZH is found with D in the typical English sound of 'J' which is allowed as a shortened form of D + ZH = DZH = J, as in 'jar' (Ln dzhahr / jahr / jar)."

Because online fonts typically make capital I (the letter after H in the English alphabet) look virtually identical to a lowercase L (letter after K in English alphabet), my convention is to try to lowercase "i" for it, so you can see the dot that's part of it, and to capitalize L (what would be "l" when lowercase). When next to each other, capital i and lowercase L do look slightly distinct often (il = Il; in the font I see, the lowercase L is slightly taller), but when not next to each other, most fonts make it difficult to tell which is which.

Note: I won't be listing the letters in alphabetical order since we're concerned with sounds here, not constructing an alphabet-like list.

## Consonants
Consonant sounds are usually either always one letter long or always two without a shorter option.

They are divided into "full" consonants (such as T, D, S, N, TH, H, KH) and "half-vowel" consonants, or half-consonants / half-vowels for short (R, L, Y, W), with the latter two of the four (main) half-vowels having closely related vowels (ee/iy/i, ue/u).

### Full Consonants

Full consonants fit within a chart arranged like the following. I'll show the full chart first and then explain them in order of unvoiced stops (UnVoiStop) (non-nasal), voiced stops (VoiceStop) (non-nasal), nasal stops (NasalStop) (voiced), unvoiced fricatives (UnVoiFric), and voiced fricatives (VoiceFric).

For now I'm only showing the main list (sounds in English (En), "ancient" Hebrew (Hb), and "ancient" Greek (Gk) -- not necessarily accurately ancient but using my chosen default pronunciations for biblical Hb and Gk). There are expanded spellings for unusual sounds as well.

|UnVoiFric|UnVoiStop|NasalStop|VoiceStop|VoiceFric|
|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
||p|m|b||
|f||||v|
|th||||dh|
|s|t|n|d|z|
|sh||||zh|
|kh|k|ng'|g||
|h|\|||||

That chart is showing sounds made with the front of the mouth on top, and further back the lower the row. I won't trouble you with the technical terms for the rows, but you can read about them [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_of_articulation).

#### Unvoiced Stops

These consonants are produced by completely blocking the airflow in the vocal tract for a moment, then releasing it abruptly. They are not voiced, meaning the vocal cords do not vibrate during articulation. Examples include **p**, **t**, and **k**.

p = normal English P, as in En **P**aul Ln PAH'L / PAHL' / PAHL- / PAHL / PAL / {Pal} / Pahl

Be aware there is an unusual sound that uses the combo PH (not to be confused with the F sound; Ln PH is the unvoiced fricative that uses the lips nearly closing, where they do close for unvoiced stop P), so if normal unvoiced stop P is followed by normal unvoiced fricative H, you must use an apostrophe between them (P'H).

NOTE: In the example Lingua spelling of En Paul above, if you were to have a second syllable after it in the same word, like En Pauline Ln PAH'L-Een / PAHL'Een, you need to include the apostrophe after either the H or the HL to clarify the H is silent, rather than the start of the second syllable.

This is because H is a full consonant but L is one of the "half-vowel" consonants, so single syllables such as "Hlunh" are possible (which is a fictional word I considered as a candidate for a name of something in my [work-in-progress edutainment stories](Cipher#fictional-language-systems-in-my-work-in-progess-edutainment-series)).

Otherwise there could have been shortened versions of En Pauline such as PAHL-Een. Since En Paul doesn't have a second syllable this isn't a problem, but it would be for names like En Solomon (Ln SAH'L-(oh)-m^n).

I would lean toward a "better" version of cases like that being the ones with the apostrophe after the HL (HL') rather than H'L, so the apostrophe can be read as implying the syllable break too. (SAHL'(oh)-m^n / SAHL'ohm^n / Sahl'ohm'n).

To simplify this guide, I'll lean toward showing less of the many alternate spellings of example words from now on. (Such as En "tall" below, which I won't show with the apostrophe since it's one syllable.)

t = normal English T, as in En **t**all Ln TAHL

T is part of normal English TH. The voiced version of it, as in En **th**in, is used in Lingua (Ln thihn / thin), so normal separator rules apply, such as in the word En boathouse Ln BOHT'haus / BOT'haus / Boht'haus.

T is also part of Ln TSH, which Lingua allows to be spelled as CH / C. I don't recommend condensing to C, but do recommend condensing to CH for speakers of StAE, since, although En CH can also mean Ln SH or K, we think of the combo as Ln TSH.

TSH is not a single sound (it's T+SH), but a sound separating apostrophe could be needed to distinguish between T+S+H, or a syllable-separating dash in some cases of T+SH.

Note you can only ("properly") condense TSH to CH when they're part of the same syllable.

So En church Ln TSH(UH)RTSH is acceptable to spell as CHRCH (or if you don't want to all-capitalize it, you can use ^ for the schwa; Ln ch^rch), but not with En outshine En aut-SHAIN / aut'-SHAIN / aut'SHAIN / aut'shain.

k = normal English K, and C or Q when pronounced as K, as in En **c**all Ln KAHL

K is part of the normal Hb/Gk sound usually well known to English speakers as the German (Gm) **CH** sound (will be explained later if you're unfamiliar). Normal separator rules apply to Ln KH (Gm CH) versus K + H (Ln K'H).

P, T, and K are the only normal English unvoiced stops in the sense of having letters in Standard American English (StAE) dialect, but we do also have the [glottal stop](https://pronunciationstudio.com/glottal-stop-pronunciation-guide/) (IPA [ʔ]).

\| = glottal stop (don't confuse with my use of pipe (|) characters to enclose an extrabiblical quote on this (BibleSeek) site), as in StAE "uh-oh" Ln \|UH-\|oh

When typing pipe in Markdown, you need to escape it with backslash; "\\|" (sometimes, but just do it always to avoid the issue.).

In many English dialects, T at the end of a syllable is pronounced as D or glottal stop but in some dialects this is done inconsistently depending on context, such as the word "boat" in StAE.

We would pronounce it in StAE usually like a shortened D ("(D)") as in StAE boat, boating, boaters, but would paradoxically pronounce it as T if we wanted to speak very clearly, as we normally do in "boathouse" or if we feel the situation we're speaking within is more formal.

And if we're in a hurry, even in StAE we would turn it into a glottal stop, but less often.

For Lingua, you may indicate this by first using the "correct" pronunciation for the dialect, then putting any others in descending order toward the least likely at the end.

So for Lingua, for the simple base word En "boat", it would be: Ln BOHT[D][\|]

Note: Don't use slashes without spaces here, and try to avoid ending a sentence with a period after a Lingua spelling if it's possible tones might be indicated (it uses unspaced-slashes and period; see [that section](#tones)). I don't worry about that in my normal pages on this site as I never indicate tones in them for pronunciations of En, Hb, Gk on them (unless otherwise stated). But that's why I left the sentence above without a period.

But you could also include spaces within the square brackets if you wanted, although it doesn't make it any shorter, to help imply the "alternate" idea. Slash with spaces before and after means alternates in Lingua.

StAE boat En BOHT[D / \|]

I normally just spell it with T, but I may include [D] sometimes below, as in that example of "boat" in the next section.

See note in the next section as well for D pronounced as T, which we (probably maddeningly for beginners) often do in StAE.

#### Voiced Stops

Voiced stops are similar to unvoiced stops but involve vibration of the vocal cords along with the blockage of airflow. They create a brief plosive sound upon release. Examples include **b**, **d**, and **g**.

P, T, and K have voiced relatives in English; B, D, and G, respectively (P --> B, T --> D, K --> G).

(My [Syllabic / Cipher SoundGlyphs system](Syllabic) uses that fact, and uses Lingua to explain it, so I'm arranging this Lingua page with that in mind, introducing sounds in the order I prefer to introduce them for Syllabic.)

b = normal English B as in En **b**oat Ln BOHT[D]

B is the voiced relative of the unvoiced P.

Be aware that B is part of an unusual combo sound BH, the voiced fricative made with the lips almost closed, where they do close for B. (Just like PH as the unvoiced relative of BH, which almost closes the lips where P does close them.) B + H as separate sounds must have an apostrophe between them as silent sounds-separator (B'H) or keep the syllable-separating dash if the B ends the previous syllable and H starts the next, as in En jobholder Ln DZHAHB'-Hohl-d^r / JAHB'-Hohl-d^r / JAHB-Hohl-d^r / JAHB'Hohl-d^r / JAB'Hold^r / JAHB'Hold'r / JAHB'Holdr / Jahb'holdr.

NOTE: To explain the last two examples of Ln spellings of En jobholder, the second-to-last "proper" and the last one a suggested Lingua-based transliteration, in the case of syllables ending with (UH)R / (uh)r / ^r, or (UH)L / (uh) / ^l (schwa + R or schwa + L), Lingua allows you to drop any indicator of the schwa as long as it's clear it isn't starting another syllable in the **pre**-vowel half-vowel-consonant location (in "JAHB'Holdr it's in the **post**-vowel location).

If it was an example using L, keep in mind that the capitalized version of L could be used in a weird non-proper transliteration to be clear that it's L in all fonts, but don't do that within a "proper" Ln spelling.

Example: En Quetzlcoatl Ln KWEHT-z^l-KOH-t^l / {KwetzLkohtL} / Kwetzlkohtl

d = normal English D, as in En **d**og

D is also part of normal English voiced version of En TH, Ln DH. Usual silent separator rule applies.

As mentioned before, D is also part of the combo of D+ZH / DZH / J. What I said of TSH / CH applies here, except I do recommend condensing DZH to J when (and only when) they're in the same syllable. (As they normally are in English words. Even in cases like En "cudgel," although the first syllable ends with D, the second also has a D at the start, so Ln KUHD-dzh^l / KUHDjl / kuhdjl

g = normal English G, as in En **g**oat

(NOT English G pronounced as J as in En gem Ln DZHEHM / JEM.)

G is part of GH, an unusual sound to be explained later (voiced relative of KH). Separator rules apply.

There is no unvoiced equivalent of glottal stop.

#### Nasal Stops

Nasal stops are produced by blocking the airflow in the mouth cavity, but allowing it to pass through the nasal cavity. This creates a combined sound with both a stop and a nasal resonance. Examples include **m**, **n**, and **ng'** (as in "sing").

#### Unvoiced Fricatives

Unvoiced fricatives are created by forcing airflow through a narrow opening in the vocal tract, resulting in a turbulent sound with friction. No vibration of the vocal cords occurs. Examples include **f**, **s**, and **th** (as in "thin").

#### Voiced Fricatives

Voiced fricatives are similar to unvoiced fricatives but involve vibration of the vocal cords along with the friction of airflow. They produce a hissing or buzzing sound. Examples include **v**, **z**, and **dh** (as in "then").






## Vowels



## Less Common Sounds

## Even Rarer Sounds

## Tones

Lingua is not ideal for portraying tones concisely. For hand-drawing, Syllabic / SoundGlyphs does have an optional version that can portray tones efficiently, such as for Mandarin.

For Lingua, you first need to know the symbols for high to lower tones.

Heights of tones are not easy to represent using keyboard symbols, when many others are taken (for example "^" is taken for schwa, dash ("-") is taken as a syllable separator). You simply have to memorize the following list which goes from high tone to low. I'll depict them on a single line so you can compare the height difference.

`+=~_

` is highest

\+ is mid-high

= is mid

~ is mid-low

_ is lowest

You can think of equals sign as "equally high and low" -- a middle pitch, and plus as adding a little to that for mid-low, while grave accent (typed with the button on a normal keyboard to the left of 1) is highest. Obviously underscore is lowest, and that leaves tilde as mid-low.

Then you need to understand how to indicate length of a tone. This is done using one of these symbols, after the pitch indicator, shown in order from shortest to longest.

,.

, is short

. is medium

Syllables default to the medium length, so the period can normally be left off.

To indicate a mid-tone short syllable (Mandarin Neutral Tone), use:

;

Representing short (the comma part) and mid-tone (the higher dot).

For mid-tone normal medium length, use:

:

Using the same logic.

Otherwise, the length indicator needs to go after the pitch indicator, and to indicate longer tones, use two, three, or more periods, similar to an ellipsis.

So, examples of length in ascending order:

,

.

..

...

....

And so on.

If your tone falls from/to any of the three middle ranges, you just have to show the pitch indicators in order from start to end.

Otherwise if it rises or falls from the highest to lowest pitch, or vice versa, you may use slashes and backslashes:

/ (lowest to highest)

\ (highest to lowest)

Keep in mind that normal slash (/) is used normally in Lingua to separate alternate spellings, but for that usage you need a space before and after the slash. Do not include spaces between any characters within a Lingua word. This should help clarify when a slash is part of a tone indicator.

Remember if you add more pitch indicators, it has no effect on the length of the tone. So a more complex tone with many pitch indicators needs to be pronounced quickly to fit in the same amount of time as one with just one pitch indicator, if no length indicator is included (which means default "." length).

The following examples will depicit the five tones in Mandarin.

To avoid confusion, I won't use slashes here to separate alternate versions; I'll use "or".

First Tone (high): \` or full version \`. to indicate normal length

Second Tone (rising): =\` or =\`.

Third Tone (falling-rising): ~_+ or ~_+.

Fourth Tone (falling): \ or \\.

Neutral Tone (mid-tone short): ; or =,

NOTE: When depicting this in Markdown files as I'm doing here (using GitHub Pages with Jekyll), the grave accent (`) and backslash can be interpreted as code so when that happens you need to use another backslash before them to escape the code behavior. I draft pages in Visual Studio Code (VSC) with the preview on to ensure they're coming out correctly. If you want to use this system you may want to do the same. But for plain text it will work as you see it on this page.

For where to put the tone indicators, you could put them right after the vowel, especially if you want to use this with some type of code-responsive system that would then convert it into Pinyin.

For normal plain text (when keyboard characters only is how it stays), I recommend putting at the end of the syllable.

They can then also serve as replacements of the dash for syllable dividers. And placing them at the syllable break will help make the spelling less confusing visually as well.
