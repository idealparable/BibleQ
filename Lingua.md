# Lingua - Keyboard Typeable Pronunciation System

Lingua could also be called SoundType. It's a subset of my [Cipher](Cipher){:target="_blank"} language systems.

## Rules of Lingua
1. **Single apostrophe (') is a silent separator of sounds**. It *must be used when two letters would otherwise be part of combination spellings not intended*. It is *not* a syllable separator.
  
    In "Lingua proper" (where the goal is to communicate the pronunciation), this is all apostrophe can imply. This should be indicated by all-capitalizing syllables with emphasis. If the word is one-syllable, you can all-cap the entire word.

    If you want to make a normal spelling such as a transliteration that's inspired by Lingua but doesn't strictly follow its rules, you could use single apostrophe "as" a schwa character, if it still looks clear to you on a case by case basis what was intended. But this would really be a schwa followed by an apostrophe, and then the schwa is just removed and implied.

    Optionally you can show single apostrophes between all sounds or any you like if it looks good.

2. **Dash is a syllable separator**. It *must be used when it would otherwise be unclear which sound goes in which syllable*. Optionally can be between all syllables.

3. *Syllable emphasis system:*
  - Syllables with **full emphasis** are **all-capitalized** / all uppercase (like "**THIS**").
  - Syllables with no emphasis are *all* **un***capitalized* / all lowercase (like "**this**").
  - Syllables with partial emphasis are *first-letter-capitalized (like "This").

  - If a syllable has either full or partial emphasis, it must be two-letters long. Syllables always have vowels, and while five vowels have optional one-letter versions, they could only be used (in proper full version of Lingua) in the two-letter versions, if there is no consonant represented (other than a silent one used within the vowel combo such as the silent H in "oh").

  - If you're representing a pronunciation guide someone else made and you don't know whether unstressed (syllables not marked as with emphasis) should be full emphasis, no emphasis, or partial, default to partial if there's one other (no-emphasis) syllable between it.

    Example, the word "syllable" itself has the first syllable emphasized in English, fully, and the third partially. If you didn't know that and you only knew the first syllable was emphasized, default the third to partial. (This rule had to be added because BLB often has this problem.) So it would look like SIHL-^-B^l.
