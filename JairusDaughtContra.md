# Jairus' Daughter Death Timing Contradiction Claim

**Bible Question:** Does Matthew contradict Mark and Luke on the timing of the death of Jairus' daughter?

This is a save of notes for a reply elsewhere. The posted reply skipped or summarized some portions; I've included here the summary and skip note in one case not posted (the others were), and the full note version that was being summarized (that wasn't posted).

In short, Matthew almost certainly has a meaning very similar to today's "you're a dead man!", and it's very clear that most likely Jairus assumed death was too late, so if Jairus did say that, he could hardly have meant she had literally died. (If he didn't, Matthew isn't in error either.)

Some lesser details have some questions that at time of writing (and offhand) I don't know the answer to, but that much is clear; the remaining questions are side trivia for the most part.

Some touch on specifically which "explanation" or "reconciliation" is correct, but as always, the burden isn't on us to prove which one is right, if any, but to prove that at least one hasn't been disproven thus far by the skeptics raising the objection, as none had by the one in the conversation where this came up, and I'm not aware of others doing so.

The skeptic is the one making the argument here, so has the burden of proof.

Right now, several options remain that skeptics to my knowledge haven't ruled out.

For now, format here is from the posts elsewhere and might mess up here. I might edit later to fix it up per my usual format here.

# Answer
No contradiction has been proven that I'm aware of, wasn't proven by the skeptic in the conversation.

At time of starting this page to store my initial long reply, the conversation is ongoing so we'll see if that skeptic or others add more there. At the very least JPH seems not to have found other arguments worth commenting on in the article I had found on it.

## Matthew

Let's put the actual accounts here for the record about Jairus since I have a moment of time for it.

All will be LSB. Square brackets (mine) are italic in LSB, indicating words not directly in original but according to LSB translators implied by the surrounding grammar. (Except square brackets with "[fn]" which is BLB footnote links, preserved in the copypaste.) Double square brackets -ing construction (mine) explain the asterisked past-tense LSB (see LSB Preface). Slashes (mine) delimit Scripture quotes. Garment incident is skipped.

Matthew 9:

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/18 While He was saying these things to them, behold, [fn]a [synagogue] [fn]official came and [fn]was bowing down before Him, and said, “My daughter has just died; but come and lay Your hand on her, and she will live.”<br><br>

19 - And Jesus got up and [began] to follow him, and so did His disciples.<br><br>

23 - And when Jesus came into the [fn]official’s house, and saw the flute-players and the crowd in noisy disorder,<br><br>

24 - He was saying, “Leave; for the girl has not died, but is asleep.” And they [began] laughing at Him./</span></blockquote>

Pause: I completely forgot that my point about Lazarus could have been made right here! Should we object that Jesus "didn't say" that she died, so Jesus must have literally meant she was merely asleep?

Addition for this article version: My point about Lazarus in the conversation prior to starting this, was when Jesus said he had merely fallen asleep, but then later clarified he meant that he had died, should his disciples object "but that's not what you said!"? Re: the skeptic objecting that "died" is what Matthew said, and any figurative meaning "isn't what it says". (My paraphrase from memory.)

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/25 - But when the crowd had been sent out, coming in, He took her by the hand, and the girl [fn]got up.<br><br>

26 - And this news spread throughout all that land./</span></blockquote>

So in Matthew, an official (translators say a synagogue one) came and was bowing. Based on the norm, our first question is if this is embedding; servants of the official coming and bowing spoken of as if the official himself personally. We know this is the case of a similar contradiction false allegation about a centurion.

Based on the arguments raised here, and cited by JPH, our next question is when the girl died.

Right here, the wording looks questionable; does "and she will live" mean that he is expected to raise her from the dead? If so, why then do people laugh at Jesus at the suggestion that the girl could "wake" when she has, according to them, died?

Another common question, of course, is whether she has been misdiagnosed as dead, but JPH elsewhere points out that ancients were typically familiar with death.

Another standard question is how chronological this all is; the norm is it isn't necessarily, but at times can be.

Another is if this is paraphrase, which it almost certainly is; the ancient norm was that other than direct copying of written documents and writing down memorized oral teachings that were repeated often, like Jesus' ministry points that he made often to many different crowds, the expectation is paraphrase, and the achronology point can be easily combined with this, that MATTHEW is saying she had died, NOT that Jairus said she died.

For example, it could have easily been known by the laughers that she had died almost immediately after Jairus walked out the door (or servants embedded in him did), so Matthew could have been justified in summarizing it as that she had died.

Why based on the rules must we rule this out? A genuine truthseeker admits contradictions might be POSSIBLE as far as we know up front in the investigation, but doesn't INSIST on any particular thing being a contradiction, and doesn't insist that the Bible must have at least one.

Based on the rules, it looks like "has died" could mean any number of things like that she has suffered something that will almost certainly kill her -- the onus is on the skeptic or any other claimer of contradiction to disprove this, not to make psuedomoralistic condescending arguments about how we're eeeevil if we dare to consider this might not be a mistake -- or just general achronology or a mix of it with paraphrase, or embedding and Jairus himself later says she died, etc.

It's POSSIBLE Jairus or servants literally said she had died, literally had seen that she had died before leaving or assumed it, and expected Jesus to resurrect her. We would also need wider investigation which might be very difficult to try to determine if his reputation as a healer already included claims of resurrections at this point.

But what we do know is that in general, it was seen as almost unthinkable that there would be 'early' resurrections, so it seems likely Jairus meant that if Jesus comes quickly, he can heal her BEFORE she dies, and that he and the laughers (maybe Jairus to less of an extent, still hoping) would think literal death is too late.

NOTE: I'm using "resurrection" in a general sense here. IIRC JPH would call this resuscitation. I'm not sure of his precise definition of it, but one is offered of both terms by JJJ in Body of Proof. By JJJ's definition this is rescuscitation IIRC.

## Mark

Mark 5:

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/21 - And when Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around Him; and so He [fn]stayed by the seashore.<br><br>

22 - And one of the synagogue [fn]officials named Jairus *came [[coming]] up, and on seeing Him, *fell [[falling]] at His feet<br><br>

23 - and *pleaded [[pleading]] with Him earnestly, saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death; [please] come, that by coming, You may lay Your hands on her, so that she will [fn]be saved and live.”/</span></blockquote>

Pause: Note that LSB Preface may suggest the present-tense is used to put the reader in the scene. This to me may imply this is literally Jairus in person, literally bowing, etc. Which would make sense of a father of a dear daughter. So less likely embedding here, and I note JPH also doesn't go that route.

Also that both Matthew and Mark put the garment incident between these things likely implies chronology. NOTE: That doesn't at all mean NO achronology is allowed. Read JPH's book sources on this, especially Misreading Scripture with Western Eyes.

But it seems like the generalities here are in roughly chronological order, that Jairus personally said something likely paraphrased here, but Matthew achronologizing about "has died" still looks likely. NOTE: JPH calls this the "freedom of composition" explanation, both in his article and 60-second vid version.

What JPH's vid version says after this (delimiting with "\|"):

<blockquote>|In an age before medical devices, there wasn't a precise way to say someone was "dead". You could just express the certainty of death without making a clinical statement."|</blockquote>

In other words, EVEN JAIRUS can be achronologizing.

Makes sense; what matters more to a father desperate to save his daughter's life? A "clinical statement" that she had technically died physically and he waited around to check to make sure before leaving?

Or that seeing she was NEAR death's door, he rushed out and expresses the URGENCY of death to Jesus? Surely it's the latter?

To insist otherwise with the red-flag parrot "sure, you can" blah blah blah looks like desperate wishful thinking to me.

Whether Jairus or Matthew phrased it that way is less clear to me; seems that so far based on the above analysis only so far (maybe others have more), neither is conclusively ruled out. The one claiming contradiction has the burden of proof to rule them out.

As a truthseeker I'm still curious which it is, though, or if something else might be going on (whether an error is here somewhere or not), but I don't need to know per se. What matters is no accusation here currently stands with sound support, and following the normal rules, there isn't even an apparent one here.

As JPH in the vid version also says, it's like the "you're a dead man" that even we have in our culture. Give it time and future wooden literalists if they were being consistent should insist we're wrong to point out that that wasn't meant literally. Yet today's wooden literalists have no excuse because even they understand it in that case.

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/5 - While He was still speaking, they *came [[coming]] from the [house of] the synagogue official, saying, “Your daughter has died; why trouble the Teacher anymore?”/</span></blockquote>



(Next in my notes I talked about the "they" but later evidence in Luke makes it clear Jairus was with Jesus at this point, so I'll skip that here.)


Pause again: The use of "they... from" here is interesting. We might need scholarship to weigh in here on if there are grammatical clues here. Obviously in context it means people from. Could be servants, could be some of the mourners, could be family, neighbors, etc. But could it suggest this should also be taken as modifying the previous case of "Jairus"?

Still, the other evidence to me seems to outweight it and imply Jairus was personally present and physically bowed, himself. Though he may have had others with him too, so could be a bit of both.


<blockquote><span class="bbq">/36 - But Jesus, overhearing what had been spoken, *said [[saying]] to the synagogue official, “Do not be afraid, only [fn]believe.”/</span></blockquote>


(I then considered if Jairus strategized by sending someone else to Jesus and Matthew embedded, so that Jairus could be with his daughter in her final moments if it failed, but later ev shows against this as said above. And makes more sense he was too upset to strategize like that and didn't trust others to hurry fast enough or beg well enough.)


Pause: Curious again. Okay, I'm seeing a bit of an "on the fence" balance of evidence here on that point (which time Jairus was there personally, if any).

It occurs to me it's certainly possible and even likely Jairus wanted to be with his daughter in case she died so he could be there personally, and that highly trusted others were sent for the first one, and in this one she has died so it's literally Jairus personally now. (I probably should have thought of that earlier...)

If so, this would open strong evidence for telescoping with some achronologizing or "dead man"-ism, with embedding earlier.

However, it IS possible, as far as I know, that this is also telescoping that Jairus physically was earlier, and now others come saying "too late" and that Jairus of course was understandably distraught, and that Jesus turned to him to say this.



<blockquote><span class="bbq">/37 - And He allowed no one to accompany Him, except Peter and James and John the brother of James./</span></blockquote>

This may be suggesting he was still managing to keep somewhat secret his use of raising-from-death miracles?

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/38 - And they *came [[coming]] to the house of the synagogue official; and He *saw [[seeing]] a commotion, and [people] loudly crying and wailing./</span></blockquote>

Commotion may imply, I would think, that she had just died, which of course fits with the need to send a "second wave" of "they".


(skipping this:)

I'll note that the dependant-on-faith-of view might help imply Jairus is personally with one wave or the other (second now seems slightly more likely but unsure... although another possibility is that when Jesus was delayed by the garment incident that Jairus was continuing home, and now is returning back to meet Jesus on the way, so we have three candidates there that I can think of).

However, I tend to think Jesus would raise her even if Jairus himself refused to believe, as it's about her, not others. Note other passages that suggest an age of accountability, and childlike faith, etc.



<blockquote><span class="bbq">/39 - And entering in, He *said [[saying]] to them, “Why are you making a commotion and crying? The child has not died, but is asleep.”<br><br>

40 - And they [began] laughing at Him. But putting them all out, He *took [[taking]] along the child’s father and mother and His own companions, and *entered [[entering]] [the room] where the child was.<br><br>

41 - And taking the child by the hand, He *said [[saying]] to her, “Talitha kum!” (which translated means, “Little girl, I say to you, arise!”).<br><br>

42 - And immediately the little girl stood up and began to walk, for she was twelve years old. And immediately they were completely astounded./</span></blockquote>

Who's within this "they"? The three disciples in question? Jairus included probably. (If all 3 Synoptics are accurate, I later noted Luke says directly it includes the parents. Skipping more discussion made moot by that.)


Others were put out, but it may be family. Complete astonishment to me fits that the girl had literally died (at some point, any point prior to this), and also, interestingly, supports that Jairus might not have believed that raising her from the dead was on the table.

This would further support that there can be no contradiction with Matthew; Matthew could hardly think that this was common belief or fail to be aware of Jairus' astonishment. He doesn't note it, but the "news spread throughout all the land" may imply it, and/or at least general astonishment.



<blockquote><span class="bbq">/43 - And He gave them strict orders that no one should know about this, and He said that some food should be given to her to eat./</span></blockquote>

This again supports that it wasn't known, per se, that Jesus did raisings from death. (As I'm calling it, whether or not we call it "resurrection" or resuscitation.) Though he says this of many healings in general and people often tell anyways, so it's still possible Jairus expected it as an option.

## Luke

Luke 8:
<blockquote><span class="bbq">/41 - And behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was [fn]an official of the synagogue. And falling at Jesus’ feet, he began to plead with Him to come to his house,<br><br>

42 - for he had an [fn]only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. But as He went, the crowds were pressing against Him./</span></blockquote>

Pause. So we have several common traits here. It looks like this is an oral unit (see JPH on the debunking of Q, and likely-debunking of Markan priority) from those later telling these accounts (perhaps, per JPH, from live notes from Matthew, but either way oral memory is normal), and including "dying" or "death" here in the formula looks like why it's here.

It doesn't likely imply Matthew meant the speaker literally said she was dead. But even if so, clearly that can be non-literal, and it looks VERY LIKELY that the speaker could hardly have meant, in Matthew or otherwise, that she had literally died already, or else it looks like it was assumed that would be too late to "trouble" Jesus with.

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/49 - While He was still speaking, someone *came [[coming]] from [the house of] the synagogue official, saying, “Your daughter has died; do not trouble the Teacher anymore.”/</span></blockquote>

Pause. This wording clearly implies Jairus was physically present in the "first wave"!

Looks like we have our most likely answer there, if we give the texts the normal grace of presuming accuracy until a strong burden of proof is met by the critic, the same standard other ancient historical documents are held to; see JPH and many others on this.

Also note that this culture was taught to pounce on what their rules ACTUALLY showed to be error and would strike texts from the canon for the slightest error). So the default is to see the three Synoptics (and anything John might contribute to any incident) as likely accurate since we have so much attestation to their acceptance.

Note: The modern, anachronizing, poorly-informed wooden literalist critic would perhaps call this "error" and think I'm saying that they just accepted types of errors we don't -- no, an intentional non-literal sense of a statement isn't an error at all.

The error is on those who read literal things figuratively and figurative things literally and/or act like having both is a problem, or pretend there's no system to objectively test which is which; there is, and when it's followed, universally the Bible passes the test.

The most desperate would probably already be whining that I'm daring to look at all the data first before coming to any conclusions of what is most likely as we walk away from reading all three... but that's pretty patently a desperate excuse.

Some who do this understandable mistake their "blur your eyes and insist on a contradiction" reaction for the more parsimonious one, but that's actually anti-parsimony (what I have called farcimony). Real parsimony first factors in ALL the data.

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/50 - But when Jesus heard [this], He answered him, “Do not be afraid [any longer]; only believe, and she will be [fn]saved.”<br><br>

51 - So when He came to the house, He did not allow anyone to enter with Him, except Peter and John and James, and the girl’s father and mother.<br><br>

52 - Now they were all crying and lamenting for her, but He said, “Stop crying, for she has not died, but is asleep.”<br><br>

53 - And they [began] laughing at Him, knowing that she had died.<br><br>

54 - He, however, took her by the hand and called, saying, “Child, arise!”<br><br>

55 - And her spirit returned, and she stood up immediately. And He gave orders for [something] to be given her to eat.<br><br>

56 - And her parents were astounded, but He directed them to tell no one what had happened./</span></blockquote>

Well well well! The critic had blurred eyes indeed! If we "take Luke literally" we HAVE to conclude that Jairus could not think that she had already died if he was physically present in the "first wave" request, and we also have to think that almost certainly he WAS present there!

The critic can still whine that this is Luke, not Matthew, or even accuse Luke of trying to salvage a contradiction between Matthew and Mark, but that, too, would be pretty desperate and against parsimony.

## Summary

So seems like MOST LIKELY what happened (keep in mind "most likely" tentatively modifies everything in the numbered list to follow) is:

1) Jairus personally sees that his daughter "is a dead girl" like today's "you're a dead man, what do you have to say to that?" or the Bible's "the old has died" etc.

2) Jairus personally in first wave.

3) We still don't know if Jairus personally said "has died" in the first wave or if that's Matthew's wording, and if it's Matthew's, we have clear evidence within this very incident's depictions that we shouldn't take it literally, thus we have no problem regardless.

4) Jairus was indeed still with Jesus during the garment interruption.

5) The second wave is others who tell Jairus for the first time of his daughter's literal death.

6) During first and second wave (at first, and even in the "her parents were astounded" later), Jairus personally assumes that physical literal death is too late, until he might begin to have some more hope when Jesus replies to the second wave.

7) This may be the first or one of the first cases of "he raised others" that is later alluded to in the "but he can't raise himself" elsewhere, or others might have successfully been kept secret, supporting that Jairus cannot have meant, nor could Matthew have thought he did, literal death had already happened in the first wave.

8) While my idea about Jairus strategically staying back with his daughter would make some sense, it would also make sense to me that he's so panicked and out of his mind with fear for his daughter that he isn't being strategic in this way, and does personally hurry out to see Jesus, while leaving his wife with their daughter probably. He might not trust others to hurry as fast or beg as well. Perhaps also seeing it as his fatherly duty.

9) This one actually IS certain far beyond any reasonable doubt: That Matthew does telescope away the mention of the second wave. This part is less clear but supported by that:

10) #9 might support Matthew telescoping in the "has died" and achronologizing. All of these can be somewhat true at the same time; Jairus could have (or Matthew on his own) could say "my daughter is a dead girl" figuratively to express the urgency while Matthew sees the telescoping that could imply as more okay for his Jewish audience, Mark and Luke translate Jairus (or the oral core paraphrase) more literally as "is dying".

## Addendum per Blomberg

A bit more: JPH cites Blomberg:

<blockquote>|there is not nearly so much difference between Matthew's arti eteleutesn in v. 18 (which could fairly be translated "just came to the point of death"; cf. Heb. 11:22) and eschates echer in Mark 5:23 (which could also be rendered "is dying").|</blockquote>

And JPH adds:

<blockquote>|Blomberg has a good point about the linguistic data. That first bit in Matthew ("even now" -- actually the Greek arti) has some connotations that suggest not always a present reality, but an inevitable reality. Note how it is used elsewhere:|</blockquote>

And he cites (quoting his KJV citation, bold is his, reproduced here by me, indicating, I presume, the term (or terms?) in question):

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/Matthew 3:15 And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so <b>now</b>: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him./</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/Matthew 23:39 For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me <b>henceforth</b>, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord./</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/1 Cor. 4:13 Being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto <b>this day</b>./</span></blockquote>

LSB for Matthew about Jairus was, to review:

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/Mat 9:18 - While He was saying these things to them, behold, [fn]a synagogue [fn]official came and [fn]was bowing down before Him, and said, “My daughter has just (arti) died; but come and lay Your hand on her, and she will live.”/</span></blockquote>

Per NASB BLB Interlinear, I've included in parentheses the term that seems to be meant. The other word Blomberg mentions is is "died".

So now it looks even more certain that Matthew (and maybe Jairus) can hardly have meant that the speaker knew that she had literally died at that point.
