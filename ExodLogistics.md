# Exodus Logistics (Initial Finds, Common Arguments)

**Bible Question:** Does the account of the exodus fail on logistics?

This is a save of my reply in a conversation that brought it up. It's an initial-reaction reply so not all points are necessarily covered. Then I went through a [JPH article](https://www.tektonics.org/af/exoduslogistics.php){:target="_blank"} and quoted portions on-topic.

# Answer
On the points I did find that JPH had covered, the logistics clearly work. I think that was the majority of them.

Keep in mind this article isn't meant as a thorough conclusion; this is more of initial notes, and a place I can also add any later findings relevant.

For now it's only about the exodus itself, as in from the actual leaving through the wandering, not including issues prior to the leaving or in the Canaan conquest. JPH's article did cover some things about the former, and a bit about Jericho.

As usual with convo saves, the format here was originally for a different site but I'll probably go through and update it later for my usual style here.

Some of the arguments here are new to me, some vaguely recall discussed. Let's see how much headway I can make. First, you shouldn't be passing on blithe "it didn't happen" claims like that. Claims like that have been debunked so often they're almost certainly false, so you run the risk of passing on misinformation, especially since in some cases here you didn't give actual support, just things like "X number doesn't make sense".

In other places you did try to offer evidence, and added more about that later though. But I do recall the claim about the high number being a problem was considered debunked a while ago. Will have to review, but I see JP Holding, a standard go-to because he does scholarship collation, has a "Logistics of the Exodus" article I can check to see if he's already covered points.

Let me start by listing the arguments.


- Claim: Grain offerings, drink offerings, oil, and animal sacrifices wouldn't work while wandering, and (you thus imply that) those laws had to be followed or were issued for the wandering, rather than just laws for the nation to take effect once they had established places.

Initial thoughts: I have done two whole-law studies but on a different topic (slavery accusation), and don't recall offhand which parts these were in. None of them seem like serious problems though, even if issues right in Exodus (the book), it's well-established that it's didactic law. If you don't know what that means also read up from JPH.

Animal sacrifices especially wouldn't be a problem so it's absolutely bizarre that it's on your list.

As for the rest, even if they were required, they could easily simply purchase them, with the bounty from the Egyptians (not to mention include oil in that bounty itself), as needed. Grain would especially be obviously meant for later when they have farms, though. So you would need a statement in the law saying they had to do it now to even have an apparent problem there.

(As I list these, keep in mind I'll see if I can return to the subject from at least JPH's article later as I get through it. Maybe more later. The Glenn Miller JPH often cites also does scholarship collation and may have content about this.)

Also matters what the sacrifices were for and how often they were proscribed, so that would need checked first too. All you say is "HUGE amounts" which is completely vague.


- Argument: If they had all this stuff to eat, why need manna and quail? But this is a pretty weird argument since if they did, for example, pack grain reserves (which would make sense), if they're forced to consume them faster, they would surely be worried about them lasting.

(This for the initial two years. Of course, the wandering is a separate situation than that, but some supplies from that could possibly have survived or have been replaced by trade.)

- Claim: 600,000 leaving Egypt is "just ridiculous." On its face, this again is a bizarre argument. We'll see about your attempts to shore it up later, but for an entire nation this doesn't seem like a surprising amount, especially since a huge population size was the reason Egypt was upset in the first place.

- Argument: There was such a thing at the time as a Sabbath's walk. I've always heard that was a later Pharisaical invention. I at least don't recall anything about it in my Mosaic Law (ML) reads so far (including several other whole-Bible studies on other topics, beyond just the two ML-focused studies so far).

- Argument: Everybody alive at the time had to go to the tabernacle every Sabbath. This argument is new to me as far as I recall, and I also don't recall anything like that. Maybe you can support it, but seems like you may be inventing rules eisegetically to create problems that don't exist.

- Argument: Population size has anything at all to do with "having to be knee-deep in excrement". That's pretty silly as I DO recall passages about that they put this outside the camp, buried it, and moved on from time to time anyways, plus this argument should then apply to all ancient populations. Again, credibility of any of these arguments is getting lower here.

- Argument: Water sources would leave traces (as in today?), and (implied) that there are none. Patterns of Exodus argues there are if Sinai is Mt. Lawz, which is the site he concludes is the best fit. I don't know on that, but the idea that traces of that would survive today is dubious at best, especially that it's relevant at all to pop. size.

- We should take all details with salt anyways; you don't need to grasp at straws to claim some are errors first in order to support that!

- The evidence is it WAS about recording the minute details and got them right, when testable so far. Its focus being about God's relationship with man isn't at all mutually exclusive with that.

Before reviewing that article, continuing through the conversation to see if anything else is worth listing here.

- Someone argues 600,000 could refer to units, like 600 families or the like.

- Claim (by someone else): Arch. shows Israelites already in Israel. No support is offered, but the claim would require a definite view of the alignment of Egyptian history and surrounding dating, etc. which are highly disputed right now.

Patterns of Evidence and CMI both offer supported alternative chronologies, and problems with conventional Egyptican chronology are well-established by now, so we would have to first figure out which of those, or any others, are right. Probably this is putting the Exodus later than it really was, or possibly mistaking Canaanite evidence for Israelite. Without more substance not much more can be said.

- It's highly unlikely the Exodus could have really just been the tribe of Levi as this person also claims. That would run into the same kinds of major problems discussed in the video!

All that said, Hebrews likely lived in Israel already. It might be conflating them. Also it's perhaps possible some Israelites had been allowed to migrate out of Egypt earlier.

- Claim: They were 11 months at Sinai. I would need to check but from my past review, it was 2 years from the exodus to the spies incident (start of the wandering), so that sounds about right. (Cites are given; Exodus 19:1, and Numbers 10:11 but need to check if "Desert of Sinai" means the actual camp at Mt. Sinai; offhand I don't recall, but let's presume so for sake of argument for now.)

- Argument: 11 months in one site makes excrement an impossible problem. This is obviously false since ancients NORMALLY spent way longer than that in one place.

- Argument: More people makes waste pits less feasible. Again, on its face this is weird. This should be a scalable solution!

Arguments about feasibility of people fitting into a candidate campsite are more plausible; not this type.

- Claim: Abe appears polytheistic (at least at first). From a quick search, Joshua 24:2 does seem to say it, but doesn't say that this situation persisted after God's call to Abraham.

Heiser argues that "god" originally included some beings we could call super-angels who were originally good, and rebelled later. I don't recall the timing, but that may be involved here. I had thought someone might have stolen idols from Terah but it was Rachel stealing them from Laban. Still, he is family.

Seems there are extrabiblical sources also claiming Abe smashed Terah's idols, but doesn't seem to be in the Bible. Certainly by the time of Moses this wasn't tolerated, if it ever was.

In any case, unclear what the argument is here anyways. If God saw the need to take time to bring Abe's descendants more in line with monolatry, that would be understandable as people can be stubborn.

- Claim: After someone pointed out the Sabbath's walk rule was later, the original arguer claims that even with that, 600,000 doesn't work, and again based on waste.

- Claim: Logistics aren't scalable. Again, this doesn't even on its face look likely. A family per cart/tent, or per number of carts/tents, should be scalable. The constraints would be on survival supplies, space in particular campsites, etc. In general the nomadic logistics do scale.

- Argument: Waste from animals matters. But this problem would exist whether mobile or static. Unless this person thinks ancients could never keep an animal alive for more than a few months when they lived in one place, this is just weird.

Though when static it could be used as manure for crops, which presumably they couldn't do in the 11 months. Might have happened during the 40 years wandering, unsure, as they could return to past campsites over time, and plan to, and plant for it ahead of time.

- (Implied) argument: Animals couldn't eat manna. Well, until we absolutely prove was manna was, it's hard to say. Since people can, more likely animals can. The animals involved also typically eat grass, and this is part of why the people who tend to raise them tend to be nomadic. This wouldn't appear to be a problem.

- Possibly implied additional argument: That it's a problem that food for animals isn't mentioned. But since ancients who maage them, both nomadic and not, clearly would have their methods for this already as common knowledge, this is a point in favor of authenticity, not against, as we would expect that they would see no need for this to be mentioned per se.

Also just from memory, IIRC it IS mentioned in the case of Moses with the burning bush before he went back to Egypt, so the reader could be fairly expected to understand that continued to apply later.

- Argument: God didn't turn the water on and off like a tap. Unclear why this is a problem since only turning it OFF would be a problem. As long as the tap is always on, there's enough water. So again, this would seem to be a point in favor, not against.

(Also even if it needs turned off from time to time, this is argument from silence.)

That's where the convo was at when I came to it. Now to JP's article.

- First topic is plausibility of expansion to that number, which wasn't raised here, so skipping, but suffice that he shows it isn't a problem, though he assumes an Egyptian sojourn of 430, and lately it has been looking to me like the evidence is slightly more in favor of the 215, but also he's using a different (much higher) number for the Exodus. Keep in mind I'm not sure what the actual number was offhand; 600,000 was just what was stated in the conversation.

- Several other arguments are considered; I'll try to limit this just to the ones brought up.

- On water (using "|" to delimit quotes):

|In terms of providing water, we see of course the miraculous provision of springs at least twice in the accounts; one may justly argue, given that the Pentateuchal narratives have been clearly designed for the purpose of oral communication, that these incidents are representative of what happened during the whole trip.

Certainly it is misguided for critics to argue using estimates of how many gallons of water, or how many trainloads of food or firewood, would be needed to support the Israelites and then remark that such provision would have been impossible in a desert setting (especially if, as some theorists suppose, the Exodus took place in a fertile part of Arabia, not the Sinai peninsula).|

(PattOEv does argue that Mt. Sinai isn't on the Sinai peninsula, and right now as far as I know that's best-supported, though I find it more ambiguous which part was considered "Egypt" but obviously they would have had to cross the peninsula either way on that point. How fertile the area around Mt. Lawz is I don't know. IIRC didn't look very.)

|Even without miraculous provision, we may add, how do they think other ancient nations survived? Were they all primitives that could not work out systems to provide for their needs? (The Scythians survived just fine without firewood; they used their own herd animals for such purposes -- the bones made for firewood, and the carcasses made do as a stirring pot.)|

- On communication and sanitation: |Similarly, one might object to the practical, everyday operation of such a community and problems such as communication and sanitation, but this is an argument that can be defeated analogically:

The Long Marchers resorted to clever practicality to solve such problems. For example, items like needles and chopsticks were carried stuck under the peaks of hats or inside puttees; children as young as 11 or 12 were used as orderlies, buglers, mess-workers, water carriers, nurses, or messengers.

A community that bands togeter against hardship is likely to do what it needs to survive. (We'll press with some practical examples from the Scythians in the next section.)|

- On tabernacle visitation:

|Critics refer to verses like Lev. 8:3-4 and Deut. 1:1 which refer to the nation of Israel being gathered to the door of the tabernacle, or Moses speaking to "all Israel" and ask how such a massive group could be gathered to such a small place, or how Moses could speak to so many people at once and be heard.

An objection like this simply failing to understand the legal view of what constituted "all" of a nation. In our article on baptism (Link below) we introduced the reader to the notion of the Semitic Totality Concept, whereby men were viewed as a totality of spirit and material; we alluded also to the fact that this concept included the idea that one part of a person who is a member of a group "sums up, comprehends and represents" all that a group is.

Therefore, in verses like the ones referred to above, all that needs be implied is that representatives (such as tribal chieftains, or representatives from each family group) be present. Those present may have actually numbered from 12 to 12,000, neither of which extremes poses a problem.

Our closest modern analogue to this kind of thought is when an official like the President gets on television and "speaks to the nation" -- it doesn't matter in such cases that some people are instead watching Hee Haw; the President is "speaking" to them whether they are listening or not.|

- On the complaining about the need for food: |As an aside, it may be asked why meat was asked for when there were so many flocks and herds. The answer: in the ANE flock animals were far more valuable for their products like wool and milk than for meat.|

- At one point he clarifies 600,000 is the number of men.

- Relevant in his Scythian comparison section:

- To any other supply not included in herds:

|"How did the Israelites get basic necessities that their herds could not produce?"
The Scythians had no problem with this. The Scythians became "fabulously wealthy" because they "taxed all trade that passed through their domain on its way to the Greek trading colonies on the Black Sea." They also provided the Greeks with wheat and other perishable commodities, receiving metals, art objects, oils and wines in return.|

This would need modified for the 2 years against grain, of course, but fits with what I said about purchase above, products like wool, etc. Keep in mind this is automatically more possible for anybody in this region to some extent too since this whole area is a trade center for geographical reasons, though where they were wandering likely less than some places like the Mediterranean road to Canaan that God had them avoid.

Also, LARGE population sizes HELP with this (military force to be reckoned with to enforce such a tax -- we know this was a practice because Israel faced some local groups who refused passage on similar grounds). So on this count, it's a problem that solves itself to some extent.

He adds: |In the same way, Israel would have been a force to be reckoned with by the traders in the area, and they had ample resources (flocks, herds, and plunder from Egypt) with which to conduct trade and get things like grain.| In line with what I said as well.

- Worth mentioning: |"What did the Israelites live in and how did they clothe themselves?"
Even if we ignore the provision that God miraculously preserved the Israelites' personal effects from wear (Deut. 8:4), this isn't too hard to fathom naturalistically.|

Pausing to note that I do think this might not have been an actual miracle but just saying God provided in general and gave them the means to keep purchasing such things to replace old ones. I say that because as far as I recall nothing like it was mentioned in the Pentateuch, just later. In any case, as he said, we can ignore this and it would still work.

|The Scythians used their herds as resources to make their clothes and dwellings. The felt of their tents was made by "wetting and pounding together wool and animal hair until the fibers interlocked, and then weatherproofed the material with grease."

Beyond that the Scythians were in constant motion looking for new grass for their herds -- even if we ignore the miraculous provision of manna, such provision should have been no more of a problem for Israel.

Think the climate of Sinai was too harsh? So was the land of the Scythians: "Scythia was, as the Ukraine is now, the prey of challenging weathers -- extreme, volatile, whimsical. Winter entombs the steppe; spring rejuvenates it." Then the summer scorches it all away with 104 degree heat.

The Israelites had it better, not having winter to deal with (even if we assume they were in Sinai and not Arabia).|

- On offerings: |"How did the priests manage all those sin offerings?"
Skeptics who perform calculations to figure out that a mere handful of preists would have to do 58 jillion sacrifices a year or "43 sacrifices an hour, around the clock" and so on are simply failing to read ancient law codes within their didactic context. Just as Hillers says of Deuteronomy and other law codes:

...there is no evidence that any collection of Near Eastern laws functioned as a written code that was applied by a strict method of exegesis to individual cases. As far as we can tell, these bodies of laws served educational purposes and gave expression to what was regarded as just in typical cases, but they left considerable latitude to local courts for determining the right in individual suits. They aided local courts without controlling them.

...it is equally doubtful that the Israelites applied (or had to apply) Leviticus in any such pedantic manner as described, but that "considerable latitude" was given in extraordinary situations. Priests can sanctify helpers; the poverty-stricken can forego the full ritual sacrifice (or other observations) until such time as it can be affored.

Living in the wilderness no doubt meant "considerable latitude" was given as well. Perhaps whole families or clans could bring a single sin offering for a year, for example. The mistake made is turning Yahweh into the fundamentalist that certain critics are.|

- On 1000: |One proposed solution to the Exodus numbers matter which simply reduces the totals and resolves all of the objections with one fell swoop. The answer in sum: The word translated "thousand" ('elep) ought rather be read as, "family units". Thus for example, as Sarna relates [Sarn.EE, 99], Reuben's "46,500 grown males" would be read as "forty six units".| (NOTE: I'm not endorsing that per se but it would need ruled out. Mentioning since it was raised here earlier.)

Conclusion not included in the conversation:

I think most of the points were indeed covered there.

On things like oil, basically the argument was flawed in TWO ways; reading in things it didn't say about how necessary these were, plus falsely thinking they couldn't get them at all.

I didn't end up finding when the issuing of those laws was, but as expected, it isn't a problem if pre-Deut.
