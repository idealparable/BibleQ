# Did Lazarus Write John? Is he the Disciple Jesus Loved?

**Bible Question:** Did Lazarus write the gospel of John? Or did John? Is Lazarus the "disciple Jesus Loved"? (DiLoved for short.) Does it matter?

My answer will be that the author and DiLoved are both John, evidently, and it matters indirectly to some surprisingly important topics, including:

- Trinity in Genesis.

- Authorship of sections of Genesis evidently compiled by Moses.

- How to tell when "all" is literal ("literall") and similar hermeneutic rules of proper exegesis.

- Debunking countless supposed Bible contradictions.

- Why Jesus ordered some to keep his messianic and divine nature secret for a time.

- Why John's opening is so "odd" and some of his teachings might seem out of the blue yet weren't controversial.

- Also why Mark seems also to be the anonymous young man in the gospel of Mark.

- How this makes John consistent with biblical-era Hebrew culture as understood by social scientists.

NOTE: I'm unsure how many Lazarus = DiLoved proponents also think Lazarus would be the author of John, but the wording around three key uses of DiLoved, at the first use, at the cross, and in the final chapter of John, make it clear it's the author.

Some may also argue for a cooperative authorship role of both, which is less problematic, but I think is unnecessary.

This is the short answer version of a longer groundwork article / study notes / draft attempt [here](DidLazarusWriteJohn).

# Answer
Let's start with what the "authorial avoidance" means -- why we see places where (at least) one person is mentioned and seems to have a major role (at times), yet isn't identified by name.

Biblical culture was honor/shame-based, not like our modern "Western" guilt/innocence culture.

Honor/shame is about how people other than you see you.

Guilt/innocence is about how you see you.

Biblical honor/shame includes the idea that the omniscient God will judge everyone at the end of the fallen era, and in some ways at each person's death. So ultimately committing any sin earns shame -- God declaring that you have done wrong, whether you admit it or not -- and honor -- God recognizing something good about you, whether you recognize it or not.

Among humans there was also honor/shame -- what your society saw as good or bad.

An example of the conflict between these two assigners of honor or shame is seen crucially at the resurrection of Christ:

> <span class="bbq">/Hebrews 12:2 1 Therefore let’s also, seeing we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let’s run with perseverance the race that is set before us, 2 looking to Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, <b>despising its shame,</b> and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God./</span>

This means that he was aware that humans at the time would think that Christ was shamed, legitimately by man, and ultimately by God (or among Gentiles, they would think by gods), but he scorned that false perception (also that human sin, which he bore the punishment for, *is* legitimately shameful), and that the resurrection made it clear that the omniscience God doesn't agree with the condemnation of Christ.

This is also what Daniel, writing to an audience during the Babylonian exile that might include outsiders, gave the literal meaning of hell:

> <span class="bbq">/Daniel 12:2 Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to everlasting life, **and some to shame and everlasting contempt**./</span>

A complication about the biblical-era view, at least in the perception of humans at the time, was that honor was a limited resource (limited good).

This made sense because honor would determine who others would give resources, which really were finite for mere humans, barring the rare miracle. While God doesn't have that limit, humans left to themselves do.

So a major rule in their culture was to avoid seeming to try to claim too much honor for yourself.

If you did, you would be perceived as unfairly robbing honor from others.

Avoiding the perception of trying to claim too much personal honor was especially needed when you were authoring historical narrative about events you played a major role in.
