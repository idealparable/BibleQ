# Did Lazarus Write John? Is he the Disciple Jesus Loved?

**Bible Question:** Did Lazarus write the gospel of John? Or did John? Is Lazarus the "disciple Jesus Loved"? (DiLoved for short.) Does it matter?

This is the short answer version of a longer groundwork article / study notes / draft attempt [here](DidLazarusWriteJohn).

My answer will be that the author and DiLoved are both John, evidently, and it matters indirectly to some surprisingly important topics, including:

- Trinity in Genesis.

- How to know when "all" is literal and similar hermeneutic rules of proper exegesis.

- Debunking countless supposed Bible contradictions.

- Why Jesus ordered some to keep his messianic and divine nature secret for a time.

- Why John's opening is so "odd" and some of his teachings might seem out of the blue yet weren't controversial.

- Also why Mark seems also to be the anonymous young man in the gospel of Mark.

- How this makes John consistent with biblical-era Hebrew culture as understood by social scientists.

I'll try to cover that we have abundant internal and external evidence that John wrote John, and used authorial avoidance of his own name within the body text, but signed it "John" on the scroll tag, or that a scribe may have taken dictation directly from John to that end.

This is due to a major aspect of their culture about avoiding beating people over the head with how important you are for major roles you played in events told in the historical narration genre, to avoid seeming to try to claim too much personal honor for the author. They perceived honor as a limited good, so to do that would seem to rob others of honor due them.

It looks like Jesus himself authored Genesis 1 through 2:4, signing it in 2:4 as Yahweh God / the LORD God, though this point is disputed heavily by many.

Later authors tended to use third-person for themselves with little clarifications that was them, or in first-person epistles it was clearly okay to openly use your own name within the body text (as Revelation also does).

I'll begin with a summary of the core reason I see that John probably began referring to himself as DiLoved, in the first use, then I'll summarize and respond to pro-Lazarus arguments for him as the Disciple Loved (DiLoved), and/or as author of the gospel of John, from what I could find online. Then I'll list internal and external support for Johannine authorship and identity as DiLoved.

NOTE: I'm unsure how many Lazarus = DiLoved proponents also think Lazarus would be the author of John, but the wording around three key uses of DiLoved, at the first use, at the cross, and in the final chapter of John, make it clear it's the author.

Some may also argue for a cooperative authorship role of both, which is less problematic, but I think is unnecessary.
