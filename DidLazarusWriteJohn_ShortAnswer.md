# Did Lazarus Write John? Is he the Disciple Jesus Loved?

**Bible Question:** Did Lazarus write the gospel of John? Or did John? Is Lazarus the "disciple Jesus Loved"? (DiLoved for short.) Does it matter?

My answer will be that the author and DiLoved are both John, evidently, and it matters indirectly to some surprisingly important topics, including:

- Trinity in Genesis.

- Authorship of sections of Genesis evidently compiled by Moses.

- How to tell when "all" is literal ("literall") and similar hermeneutic rules of proper exegesis.

- Debunking countless supposed Bible contradictions.

- Why Jesus ordered some to keep his messianic and divine nature secret for a time.

- Why John's opening is so "odd" and some of his teachings might seem out of the blue yet weren't controversial.

- Also why Mark seems also to be the anonymous young man in the gospel of Mark.

- How this makes John consistent with biblical-era Hebrew culture as understood by social scientists.

NOTE: I'm unsure how many Lazarus = DiLoved proponents also think Lazarus would be the author of John, but the wording around three key uses of DiLoved, at the first use, at the cross, and in the final chapter of John, make it clear it's the author.

Some may also argue for a cooperative authorship role of both, which is less problematic, but I think is unnecessary.

This is the short answer version of a longer groundwork article / study notes / draft attempt [here](DidLazarusWriteJohn).

# Answer
Let's start with what the "authorial avoidance" means -- why we see places where (at least) one person is mentioned and seems to have a major role (at times), yet isn't identified by name, and why I think John embraces this more than other biblical authors.

In short, I think it's clear he was following Christ's lead, and that this is the mark of authorship most likely to be associated with Christ's top disciples who would be traveling with him during his ministry, which means Peter, John, and James are strong candidates, while Lazarus isn't, as Lazarus seems to have largely stayed in Bethany and supported Christ's ministry financially.

I think John may have gotten this from Mark's lead, following Peter, or both directly as the most central disciples, from Christ's focus on Genesis as foundational and his emphasis on avoiding too much direct credit as the Messiah.

I think Mark and especially John paid very close attention in Genesis and noticed that the pre-Incarnate Christ signed the first section in 2:4 and avoided mention of himself within the body text, but that Genesis 1-2 together make it clear he was there and has personal distinction from both the Father and the Spirit (who also have personal distinctions).

The longer groundwork articles goes through much more detail about that than I'll cover in this summary, but suffice to say, John echoes many of the details of Genesis, including some that might not be as obvious as "In the beginning," and this seems much more likely for John than Lazarus.

Also, details around the final chapter of John make it clear that the author is the "disciple who Jesus loved" (DiLoved), and that this applies also at least to the Last Supper use.

At least one promoter of the view that it's Lazarus instead has argued that the fact that the DiLoved phrase isn't used until after Lazarus' resurrection is evidence that it's Lazarus.

I see, though, strong evidence in the same chapter as the first use (Last Supper), that a close friend of Peter's, who John is a much better candidate for, had reason to be very focused on a statement of Jesus in that same chapter and event about love.

I see that he's using authorial avoidance all along, including one in John 1 who seems most likely to be either John or James since he was with Andrew, Peter's brother, and we know all four of them worked together as fishermen, and in the Last Supper chapter (as we divide it today), John developed the DiLoved version of the avoidance because now he was introducing why he coined the phrase.

That is:

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/John 13:34 A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also love one another.

35 By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”/</span></blockquote>

Then the author of the gospel of John continues to self-reference both with more generalized avoidance, and sometimes interchangeably with the DiLoved phrase. It makes sense that he wouldn't use the phrase earlier so the attentive, normal reader (who reads in order, and looks to immediate context to understand why something is phrased how it is) wouldn't be confused.

The Last Supper simply happens after the resurrection of Lazarus, so I find that argument to commit the false cause fallacy (that just because something happens later that it was caused by something earlier).

There are other arguments, but first let's cover in more detail something that's crucial here so it's worth covering thoroughly even for a short answer.

## Why Authorial Avoidance?

Biblical culture was honor/shame-based, not like our modern "Western" guilt/innocence culture.

Honor/shame is about how people other than you see you.

Guilt/innocence is about how you see you.

Biblical honor/shame includes the idea that the omniscient God will judge everyone at the end of the fallen era, and in some ways at each person's death. So ultimately committing any sin earns shame -- God declaring that you have done wrong, whether you admit it or not -- and honor -- God recognizing something good about you, whether you recognize it or not.

Among humans there was also honor/shame -- what your society saw as good or bad.

An example of the conflict between these two assigners of honor or shame is seen crucially at the resurrection of Christ:

> <span class="bbq">/Hebrews 12:2 1 Therefore let’s also, seeing we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let’s run with perseverance the race that is set before us, 2 looking to Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, <b>despising its shame,</b> and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God./</span>

This means that he was aware that humans at the time would think that Christ was shamed, legitimately by man, and ultimately by God (or among Gentiles, they would think by gods), but he scorned that false perception (also that human sin, which he bore the punishment for, *is* legitimately shameful), and that the resurrection made it clear that the omniscience God doesn't agree with the condemnation of Christ.

This is also what Daniel, writing to an audience during the Babylonian exile that might include outsiders who wouldn't necessarily be as likely to understand Hebrew figures of speech, gave as the literal meaning of hell:

> <span class="bbq">/Daniel 12:2 Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to everlasting life, **and some to shame and everlasting contempt**./</span>

In the Christian context, this means that God recognizes that these individuals haven't accepted Christ's atonement, so they must pay the price themselves.

The honor/shame system is probably what Daniel means also in the next verse about "light" for those raised to everlasting life; that light here likely refers to honor, through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, possible despite our sin due to Christ's atonement.

> <span class="bbq">/Daniel 12:3 Those who are wise will shine as the brightness of the expanse. Those who turn many to righteousness will shine as the stars forever and ever./</span>

Although this would mean this is figurative in Daniel, the literal explanation of one of the two sides of the coin would have clued Babylonian or other outsider readers in that this is talking about honor/shame, which was a key aspect of all ancient cultures.

Note John identifies Christ with life and light:

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/John 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 The same was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made through him. Without him, nothing was made that has been made. 4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasn’t overcome† it.<br><br>

6 There came a man sent from God, whose name was John. 7 The same came as a witness, that he might testify about the light, that all might believe through him. 8 He was not the light, but was sent that he might testify about the light. 9 The true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world.<br><br>

10 He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world didn’t recognize him.<br><br>

...<br><br>

14 The Word became flesh and lived among us. We saw his glory, such glory as of the only born‡ Son of the Father, full of grace and truth./</span></blockquote>

A complication about the biblical-era view, at least in the perception of humans at the time, was that honor was a limited resource (limited good).

This made sense because honor would determine who others would give resources, which really were finite for mere humans, barring the rare miracle. While God doesn't have that limit, humans left to themselves do.

So a major rule in their culture was to avoid seeming to try to claim too much honor for yourself.

If you did, you would be perceived as unfairly robbing honor from others.

Avoiding the perception of trying to claim too much personal honor was especially needed when you were authoring historical narrative about events you played a major role in.

This is for example behind why Jesus typically ordered people not to tell others yet who he was (as Christ, the Son of God). JP Holding, a source I often use (see end notes), says:

<blockquote>|We may first note that there were social reasons why Jesus had to be circumspect in His proclamations of divinity:<br><br>

<blockquote>
• a need for Jesus to avoid the loaded term "Messiah" which might be assumed to be military;<br><br>

• the social constraint of Jewish apocryphal texts, including the Psalms of Solomon and 4 Ezra, which said that only God could declare who the Messiah was.
</blockquote>

By this line of thinking, as Charlesworth puts it, "Any self-designation only proves that the proclaimer cannot be the Messiah." Thus, <b>Jesus' relative silence on the issue "may well be an implicit indication that he thought of himself as the Messiah</b>." (ibid.) We have also noted that the Messianic secret theory misses the point that despite these admonitions to silence, Jesus' subjects did go out and tell the story anyway.<br><br>

But there was an even more primary social reason for <b>Jesus' hesitation for word to spread of himself and his work</b>. Pilch and Malina explain in the Handbook of Biblical Social Values [59ff] three social paradigms that come into play:<br><br>

<blockquote>1. Envy -- the begrudging of possession of some quality or object by another.<br><br>

2. Limited Good -- the ancient perception that all good things are limited and finite in quantity, including intangibles, like:<br><br>

3. Honor -- the accord given by a person to others, a value in the ancient world that they took as seriously as we today take paying the bills.</blockquote>

Taken together, these factors tell us that Jesus' reticence is an example of what would have been regarded as honorable behavior in the ancient world. <b>For Jesus to have been plain about his divinity and Messianic nature in public would have aroused serious envy (as we do see it did, from his opponents, <i>especially in John</i>)</b> as he would have been claiming a high level of honor, and this would have been seen as drawing from the well of honor, which was a "limited good". Thus to make such claims would have been seen as taking honor from others.<br><br>

The society of Wrede's day was one of limitless good, and without such heavy concentration on honor; hence it is little wonder Wrede came up with the explanation of a "Messianic secret". In an individualist society with limitless good, the thing to do is go out and share what you have with others, and even brag about it. The world Jesus lived in would have found such behavior intolerable -- as did his opponents, and as did the residents of Nazareth.<br><br>

One more point needs to be noted: Why is it that Jesus often stopped demons from speaking of him? This has been appealed to as part of the Messianic secret theme, but in fact it is not, and the reason for it is different than the above. Malina and Rohrbaugh (Social Science commentary, 183) note that the demons were seeking to protect themselves by "magically using" the "true identity" of Jesus. A desperate move, yes, but deserving of a rebuke, and not an element of Messianic secrecy.|</blockquote>

## Trinity in Genesis

In biblical Trinitarianism, none of the three Persons of the Trinity have any intrinsic superiorities to others, but Christ and the Spirit are functionally subordinate to the Father as roles.

Despite many Unitarians' strawmen, we expect to see Jesus and the Spirit looking to the Father as the ultimate authority.

So ultimate honor is depicted as belonging to the Father, without any implication of Christ being in any way a separate or lesser entity. He's a distinct Person and has distinct roles, however, and it makes sense that he would model focusing praise to the Father. The full reasons for this are beyond the scope of this short answer article but are covered essentially in the long version.

John sees Christ as the Word, because he personifies (and always has; he is not a created entity; he has no beginning) God's thoughts and expressions of those thoughts.

If we take as a hypothesis that Christ authored Genesis 1-2:4 and John noticed, and both used authorial avoidance, this explains why we get a different term used in 2:4 (a toledoth line, most likely a signature line) and onward in what I think is the account of Adam, the LORD God / Yahweh God, used interchangeably about who created humans with just "God" in Genesis 1, so there's some kind of distinction between the two, yet also some kind of equivalence.

This fits distinct Personhood yet the same Being in biblical Trinitarianism.

John sees creation as being performed through Christ.

This is also explained if my hypothesis is correct; Genesis is hinting that the signer of the account is the one who carried out, to some extent, the creative work usually is phrased in a way that avoids mention of who did it.

Even when it does say God made, to explain how "it was so," this is rare within the passage.

And John sees Jesus as light and thinks to put this not just associated with heaven as Daniel does but with creation.

In Genesis, the clearest parallel with light, though, is with the Spirit, not the Son.

As I put it in the longer article:

<blockquote>Notice also that the Spirit is stated, but then mysteriously seems to be missing.<br><br>

Notice how a Hebrew would understand the parallelisms in this section:<br><br>

Genesis 1:<br><br>

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/2 The earth was formless and empty. Darkness was on the surface of the deep and God’s Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters.<br><br>

3 God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 4 God saw the light, and saw that it was good. God divided the light from the darkness./</span></blockquote>

Throughout the Bible, "deep" is a synonym for a large body of water such as the Mediterranean (the "deep" that Israelites primarily were around), and can refer to oceans.<br><br>

Note:<br><br>

Genesis 1:<br><br>

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/9 God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear;” and it was so./</span></blockquote>

From this it's commonly thought (as the findings related to Dr. John Baumgardner's Flood model appear to clearly confirm) that there was originally a single supercontinent, broken up during the Flood, and thus a single super-ocean as well. Prior to land, it was just all water on the surface, thus "earth" (dry land per verse 10) was "formless and void" or empty.<br><br>

What was over the water? It's unclear if there was air yet; that may be what was primarily added on Day 2, but in any case, we do know two things above the water, as the parallelism shows:</blockquote>

A table was then shown, which is easier to format outside of the block quote:

||darkness|was|on|the surface of|the deep|
|(and)|God's Spirit|was|hovering over|the surface of|the waters|

Continuing:

<blockquote>In other words, the Spirit was dark -- not shining, not making light yet.<br><br>

This in turn means that the Spirit of God / God's Spirit, the Holy Spirit was the source of light in the next few verses!<br><br>

Now, again, the Spirit is said to have inspired all Scripture.<br><br>

...<br><br>

That means he had... an implied authorial role in Genesis 1 through 2:4 as well.<br><br>

He doesn't need to sign the account, and it's more "okay" to put his name (or a name for him) within the account, unlike the Word, but there's still partial authorial avoidance by the Spirit.<br><br>

Notice also the "loud voice" is what John picks up on to reveal what Jesus said (it is finished) [see longer article for context; this is what Jesus says on the cross in John]. This according to a source I follow, Anthony Rogers, is actually referring to a title for the theophany of the Son in the garden; that it isn't just that they heard the audible voice of the theophany of God, but that the theophany was titled the Voice of God.<br><br>

This is likely a big part of where John (Philo, etc.) God the idea that the one we now know as the Son is the "Word" / Logos / Memra, and it further evidences that John is seeing the one who speaks as the Word. Yet the words in Genesis are attributed to the one called simply God (the NT also tends to prefer this term as a concise option for the Father, though at times it refers to the shared essence or being as when the Word IS God).<br><br>

So the idea here is that the Father was Breathing Out the Voice/Word, when he breathed out the voice/word of each instruction he said, and the Voice/Word then carried out those very instructions, through the Spirit.<br><br>

So, Father (unchanging God) constantly "emits" the radiance of his being, his intrinsic and beginningless wisdom and the ideas that can be expressed as words, which have always been personified, and his action principle (the Spirit). Carrying with Him, the Word/Wisdom/Son expresses specific instructions and carries them out, acting as a sort of directing agent for the direct creative action of the Spirit.<br><br>

This is what Genesis teaches, if [my Genesis authorship theory is right; Sig-After-Until-Abe (SAUA)], and it also just happens to be what the NT teaches in extreme levels of detail.<br><br>

And all of it directly supports that John saw these details and learned authorial avoidance.<br><br>

So it's very clear that John used the cases of avoidance as self-reference without the name, much like Christ did in his account of creation.<br><br>

In John's case, the phrase he picked as the self-reference appears to be based on the significant statement Jesus said during the first incident where in the account of it the author of the gospel of John uses the "disciple Jesus loved" phrase (DiLoved).<br><br>

Remember, in the <i>He</i>Loved section about Lazarus, there's nothing anonymous about it.<br><br>

I see in this, as said near the start of this article, thus, John expressing his newfound style of phrasing, in paraphrasing the messengers, not a hint that DiLoved is Lazarus.<br><br>

So, John is seeing, due to authorial avoidance and Christ's signed authorship of Genesis 1-2:4, that the <b>Son</b> is the Light that shone out through the Spirit over the waters.<br><br>

Without these premises, you don't naturally get to the conclusion John clearly reached that led him to phrase things as he did.<br><br>

It's certainly possible John was revealing new information, but let's give God the grace of the ability to speak clearly using the rules of the initial target "language culture" -- the rules that *do* lead to these conclusions, even if they might not seem immediately obvious if you aren't paying close attention, as John would.</blockquote>

## HeLoved

A major argument for Lazarus as DiLoved is that messengers tell Jesus that Lazarus is sick, and the wording in John is similar to the "disciple Jesus loved" phrase:

> <span class="bbq">/John 11:3 The sisters therefore sent to him, saying, “Lord, behold, he for whom you have great affection is sick.”/</span>

One proponent of Laz=DiLoved I found online even claiming this is here said to be the <i>disciple</i> Jesus loved.

It really only says "he" whom you loved, hence my abbreviation HeLoved.

Also the argument backfires when you keep in mind that Greek had no quote marks, and in their culture they normally paraphrased content of what someone else said.

So this is the <i>author's</i> wording, most likely.

I see this actually as further evidence for John's authorship.

Both because he phrases it differently from DiLoved, and because this author who seems to be close to Peter both in John 21 (final chapter) and at the Last Supper paraphrases the messengers' message in this way.

The fact that this is shortly before the Last Supper intro of DiLoved only further supports that John is leading up to the introduction of that term in steps, clarifying up front that Jesus loved others, not only the author.

In the longer article I also noted abundant extrabiblical evidence that both the gospel of John and the three epistles of John were written by John, and listed many similar passages in John and 1/2/3 John, including an emphasis on love, and authorial avoidance.

John does self-identify within the body text for Revelation. I cover why I think that's not a problem in detail there; in short, it was mainly historical narrative that had the problem, not prophetic works or epistles, and Revelation is a mix of both (compare Isaiah's first-person in-text self-references and the many like it in Paul for example).

Third-person was also valid for historical narration.

This is the norm for the vast majority of the Bible.

I think if Lazarus was the author of John (to be fair, perhaps not all Laz=DiLoved proponents argue that, but that in itself would be a problem due to John 21), Lazarus would have likely chosen third-person and would have used his name at the Last Supper, at the cross, and in the final chapter, but might have been more hesitant to clearly say he's the author at the end than DiLoved is.

I think it's significant that the gospels attributed to Mark (top student of Peter's), and the one attributed to John, who worked with Peter and is often shown to be close to him throughout all four gospels, both appear to use authorial avoidance.

Yet Matthew uses the normal third-person in his gospel, and Luke uses weird (anonymous) first-person in his introductions (as if he mixed the epistle norm with the anonymity-in-body-text).

Mark has one anonymous young man fleeing at the arrest of Jesus, and John has many anonymous cases of third person, and closes by clarifying that that person is the author, self-referenced with first-person.

So it seems this practice is associated not just with the 12 or other top disciples, but specifically with Peter... and... Lazarus?

It makes much more sense if it's a practice among the inner group (Peter, James, and John), or even just Peter and John, than that the practice skipped over Matthew, who traveled along for Jesus' ministry, yet then shows up with Lazarus, who evidently (normally?) didn't.

## Disciple Known to Caiphas

It's also argued that Caiaphas can't know a fisherman, but is likely to know someone from Bethany. I focused on this a lot in the long article.

For here, suffice to say that most likely Caiphas knew John as one of the top disciples of Jesus -- a face often spotted near when Jesus was causing trouble for the leadership -- and this disciple is associated with Peter as well, and seems to be the same one identified as the DiLoved at the cross, seemingly much closer to the cross than others.

This disciple is also entrusted to take care of Mary, Jesus' mother, and given that John and Mary both normally live in Galilee, so the location argument works both ways, and even knowing a fisherman is hardly impossible, as I explored in great detail in the longer article.

It's true that the unnamed disciple in John 1 is in Bethany at one point, which would make some sense if it's Lazarus, but is traveling with Andrew, evidently, and clearly isn't Peter since Andrew had to tell Peter about what he found out (Jesus=Christ). So it's most likely James or John.

And given that he knew very specific details down to hour of the day for events in John 1, I think this is the author -- John.

And we similar levels of perspective detail about who is where when in John, especially about who moved where in the courtyard where Peter denied Christ, and where Pilate walked.

Again, it makes much more sense if this is the DiLoved who is the author per John 21.

## DiLoved = Fisherman and "Therefore it is the Lord"

The objection that Caiaphas can't know a fisherman also backfires because the DiLoved in John 21 spends all night fishing, and we're even told that because Jesus gave them accurate fishing instructions, the DiLoved "therefore" said it was the Lord.

This is clearly mirroring a similar incident at their calling, and we're told, as I show in the long version, that this included Peter, Andrew, James, and John.

Note that the next verse makes it clear they were much too far away for the "therefore" to be about recognizing Jesus' appearance.

It clearly means someone present during the original call -- a fisherman -- was recognizing that Jesus was re-enacting that event.

We're also told the names of three onboard -- Peter, Thomas, and Nathanael (who I showed in long version is likely Bartholomew), then "sons of Zebedee," then two unnamed others.

I see a switch to authorial avoidance but with a strong hint, in changing to avoiding the direct names midway through this list.

It could be argued that you don't really have to be a fisherman to go aboard a fisherman's boat (although the captain/owner of that boat might disagree), or you could at least help out, so maybe one of the two is Lazarus.

I showed, though, that most likely it's Andrew and Philip (associated with Bartholomew/Nathanael), and the reason they aren't named is for plausible deniability (not literally denying) so the authorial avoidance can be preserved.

(Plausible for a reader to think the author might be one of them instead of one of the sons of Zebedee -- but if it isn't John, why not just list James and John, and then say two others? So the author also hints that he's either James or John. And we see John associated with Peter much more often.)

Also, since John the Baptist (Bap, for short) was often baptizing -- in water -- it makes more sense to me that a fisherman is likely to be among his closest disciples than some rich guy in Bethany.

Again, admittedly Bap was in Bethany in John 1, but since he's the cousin of Jesus, and Jesus is friends with Lazarus, that isn't surprising.

Another argument, by the way, is that Lazarus is only in John's gospel.

Let's assume that's true for now.

If so, this makes sense, and in a way that would connect John to the unnamed disciple in John 1, and further back up John as DiLoved in John 21, again because Bap was Jesus' cousin and John (son of Zebedee) seems to have been a top disciple of both of them. Basically, both Lazarus and John were close to Jesus.

So it would make sense if John wrote John, and had no problem calling Lazarus by name within the book, but not himself, and focused on Lazarus while other gospel writers didn't.

If, however, Lazarus is DiLoved (and thus apparently has to be the -- or an -- author of John), it's weird that he's named in one place (and even one that would put him in a highly honored position as friends with Jesus and resurrected early by him), not in so many others, and that he does seem to have a problem with mentioning John by name anywhere.

I'm also not convinced Lazarus is only in John.

Luke also has Jesus using a name for a person in a parable, which is very odd for Jesus (and Luke, and any of the gospels), and it's also about someone who dies, and there's even someone who wants him to come back to life.

I see three likely explanations.

Jesus may have been alluding to Lazarus' resurrection.

Regardless of whether the parable came first, or the raising of Lazarus, this works. In the one case, a prophetic hint, in the other, people would see it as alluding to the themes of what he demonstrated with Lazarus and making it more memorable (and that value would also work later with the prophetic case).

That's two of the main options.

The third is that Jesus is passing on a true story about Lazarus.

He may have done this at times in some of his parables. After all, he's omniscient; he can easily use true stories in his metaphors, seeing how something that he saw as happening that fits common events that people will be familiar with, for example, related to the thing he's teaching.

This one seems a bit unlikely due to the Lazarus in the parable seemingly having been poor and afflicted all the way to death.

It doesn't necessarily mean that; perhaps Lazarus as a leper was cut off from his family's wealth and restored if Jesus healed him, and Jesus is just skipping over those details irrelevant to the parable.

In any case, I think it's most likely that one of these is the case, I just have no idea which one.

Also, John may have outlived Lazarus (the second time), and been more free to use his name more openly when he wrote his gospel than the other three.

## That Guy Named John

I also covered in the long article that the author of John refers to Bap as simply John more than others, according to JPH.

This makes sense if the author is also named John, and is accustomed to thinking of other people named John as simply John, not needing to clarify that it isn't himself as much as others would.

I also noticed that he refers to Peter's father's name, John. In the long article I thought that was unique to the gospel of John due to a word search turning up no other results, though I noticed weirdly that WEBP translates it Jonah even though the word is the same as John.

After writing that article I noticed that Matthew does have it, but fused as one word with the Aramaic "son of" bar at the front, when Jesus responds to Peter's confession of faith, as "baryona" (Barjona; Bar Jona). This might be where WEBP got the idea that it's Jonah. But from what I found, it does look like in Hebrew Jonah and John are essentially the same thing.

Still, this only reduces the weight of the evidence; it remains so that John (gospel) has cases of emphasis on the name of Peter's father, which happens to be John.

Also, this is Jesus' statement (paraphrase of it most likely), and so is the one in John 21 (well, the three). So it seems like Jesus was the one saying it, but it still seems like John made sure to include it possibly because he notices when people are named John.

## NonliterALL

This was about Jesus and narrators saying that "all" the disciples scattered, yet the unnamed disciple who Caiaphas knew (or a servant of his may have known, etc. -- see section on embedding in the longer article) didn't scatter, so it's argued, so must not be a disciple.

This argument has immediate problems in that Peter is also a disciple (though he shortly denies it), and that obviously the "disciple" whom Jesus loved is a disciple.

I find the former is a serious problem for Laz=DiLoved, the latter is questionable, but admittedly the word can be used in multiple senses.

But then, Lazarus could also be among those told that all of them would scatter, or among all disciples said to have scattered, and presumably would be if he was this unnamed disciple since we're told this one was with Peter.

That aside, let's grant that "disciples scattered" can be a smaller group than disciples in general, and ignore the Peter problem. And I granted and cited in the long article that "disciple" can indeed have as wide a meaning as any Christian.

On those premises, they could argue that "all" has to be a literal all (of the type of disciple that doesn't include Lazarus), or that if it doesn't we have a problem as you wouldn't be able to tell when all wasn't literal.

I covered in detail in the long article about how to know when "all" (or synonyms) is (most likely) literal versus when it's at least somewhat likely to be what we would call hyperbole.

Basically a single use is likely hyperbole, just cluing the reader in that a large majority / group / percentage is involved.

Two or more uses push toward literal.

I showed a standard example of "literALL" (literal all) in Genesis about the Flood's extent, with many repetitions.

This is important to the debunking of many claimed Bible contradictions, where one passage will say all of something is such and such, and another will show an exception.

It also highlights the literal nature of Jesus' creation of "all things" that were made in the opening of John; this isn't hyperbole not including himself as Unitarians might argue.

Presumably most arguing for Laz=DiLoved aren't intentionally trying to give leeway to Unitarianism, but they would unwittingly do so if some of the arguments I've found online in support of it are taken seriously, including this one.

I also gave examples against the more general related argument that poetic / nonliteral approaches are open to free interpretation or are generally unclear.

For example when Jesus told some negative parables and his opponents perceived that he was speaking about them, or Nathan's metaphor about the sheep when confronting David about his sin with Bathsheba and against Uriah.

It's true that poetic devices are sometimes legitimately less clear than literal statements (like an intentionally cryptic prophecy), but then sometimes a literal statement is less effective at communication as people might pay less attention to a boring statement, and an apt analogy can help teach a principle in common with the thing being analogized.

## Miscellaenous Mopup

For this section I'll just cover any other argument not dealt with above for Lazarus as the Disciple Loved, including more obscure ones not covered in the longer article.

Another argument is the DiLoved refraining from going in Jesus' tomb would make sense if it was Lazarus.

I find that questionable (maybe someone who walked out of a tomb would be less afraid of the things), but if we grant it, there's the problem that this disciple seems to be emphasizing competitiveness with Peter.

This makes more sense if it's someone Peter has known a long time and often is with in travels during Jesus' ministry -- John or James (or in that case maybe Andrew, Peter's brother, but I see similar signs of competitiveness about who arrives where first around Jesus' arrest, and signs that that DiLoved case is likely John).

It's argued that Peter's question about "What about him?" (paraphrase) about DiLoved in John 21 makes sense if it's about Lazarus, since Jesus had just indicated the way Peter would die.

But it also makes sense if Peter is again being competitive with John, or simply close friends with him, etc.

It's argued that Lazarus, who along with Mary and Martha seems to be wealthy (given the expensiveness of the gift Judas complained about), would be better able to support Mary than John.

But John took her into his own home, so if it was in Bethany, she would have had to move there, whereas John also lived in Galilee.

Lazarus may have fled since he was targeted for execution as well, but then that might not be as safe for Mary. Similarly, Lazarus would not likely go right into the courtyard of the high priest, the very people trying to kill him. On both counts, a "lower target" like John seems a better candidate.

And aside from John possibly being on the wealthier side as a fisherman than others (which would also help explain why Caiaphas might know him), there's also Christian charity, even if we don't factor in that the apostles might have had authority to direct funds where needed.

I think it's reasonable that Christians would be unlikely to neglect ensuring Mary, the mother of Christ himself, was well taken care of, no matter whose home she was in.

I also pointed out that the argument that Caiaphas most likely doesn't know a particular fisherman (even if we grant that the reason he might know John isn't about John's disciple role or anything else at all) named John is a particularly weak kind of argument from statistics that I call Backwards Statistics Error, or self-refuting generalization.

That is, it asks us to accept as evidence for Laz=DiLoved that an unlikely thing is probably false, but ignores at least one (and probably several) unlikely things in order to get Lazarus to be DiLoved.

The thing I agree is unlikely is Caiaphas knowing John simply in John's status as a Galilean fisherman.

But it's also unlikely that even the elite of elites knows no non-elites.

Non-elites can easily include fishermen, even fishermen from Galilee. They could have both been invited to some event, perhaps John as representative of his fishing family (as they seem to be), and the son of thunder was noticeable in his speech... or any such thing, like a distant relative in common, or a relative who's a synagogue leader who has connections to Caiaphas.

Each particular such explanation is by itself unlikely, but it's actually very likely that at least one of them could happen with some fisherman.

Put another way, it's likely Caiaphas doesn't know any one particular fisherman, but highly unlikely that Caiaphas doesn't know ANY Galilean fishermen in any of these ways.

It's argued that Lazarus likely was with Jesus in his final week, since Lazarus lived in Bethany, but so was John, as a close disciple -- and all the more so that he would be actually with him, not just living nearby.

It's argued Lazarus would be likely to want to put the emphasis on Jesus to use authorial avoidance, but then he fails much more so than John, since Lazarus is named several times.

Even the argument that HeLoved=DiLoved, which is used by at least one proponent who is also using this same argument, would, if it really implied that, be cluing the reader in likely too obviously that HeLoved=Author. So then Lazarus shouldn't have been named in any of the gospels.

Or else, if he was so central as to write one of the gospels, it's odd that nobody else mentions him (except arguably Luke by implication).

And you wouldn't be able to use the protective anonymity premise to explain that anymore, unless Lazarus only had his gospel released at his death?

Seems like a stretch.

Also the implication seems to be that those who think John wrote John (and/or is the DiLoved) have speculated so much about why John would use this authorial avoidance, that therefore it's a problem that it's John.

But the proponent who's doing this is himself speculating a reason about Lazarus doing this.

And even if he hadn't, that many people will be less informed or attentive to figure out why John did isn't really an argument. Of course some will do that for virtually anything.

It's argued they both wrote it.

While that's fine, and consistent with ancient writing approaches if Lazarus had been around (they were usually cooperative with anybody near you, within your "community", and in their type of culture, that could be anyone at any time) this is basically just conceding everything (or some unclear amount of it), yet wanting to have the cake too. It's just as easy for John to have simply wrote about people Jesus was close to from what John knew.

As far as I can see, everything about Lazarus could have been known to John, without Lazarus needing to assist in writing it or being interviewed later, etc.

Frankly, given so much overwhelming that DiLoved and the author are both John, I must wonder if the argument needs to instead be that Lazarus *is* John!

It's argued based on "we" know that his testinmony is true, in John 21:24, that this might be John and Lazarus.

And, again, it certainly can include Lazarus, but this is more likely referring to everybody involved, and/or to top students of John like Polycarp who likely helped with the gospel. It seems a bit of a stretch to see Lazarus as specifically called out here, or even in view at all.

It's asked why Peter asked DiLoved to pass on the question about who the traitor is at the Last Supper, and suggested that it's because the traitor is one of the twelve, and Lazarus isn't. But again, Peter's close friendship with John (or friendly rivalry) would also explain this, and without resorting to such roundabout reasoning.

It's argued John couldn't write a gospel, as a fisherman.

In one case because he supposedly wouldn't know Greek, but Greek was the official language per GM (see end notes) of trade for fishermen.

In another case because Peter and John are supposedly said to be illiterate in Acts 4.

But it really just says unlearned and ignorant, from the perspective of their opponents. Even if illiterate, they could easily dictate to a scribe. I showed possible evidence that Peter did this for 1st, and likely 2nd Peter, although it's argued by others that this might refer to a messenger (Silvanus/Silas) rather than a scribe per se.

Either way, use of scribes was normal, and would be easily possible for the leaders of the Christian movement.

Acts 4 is also claimed by one proponent to say that Caiaphas didn't know who John was, but it looks to me like it's saying the exact opposite; that they recognize Peter and John as disciples of Jesus. A weird translation is appealed to in order to make it look vague enough that it might mean what's argued ("took knowledge of them"), but most say things like this from WEBP:

> <span class=bbq">/Acts 4:13 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled. They recognized that they had been with Jesus./</span>

It's argued that both DiLoved and Lazarus ate next to Jesus. So, too, might a top disciple like John.

It's argued that after Lazarus was raised, he might switch to following Jesus around. But so might a known top-three student be following Jesus around.

Incredibly, one source argues based on the lack of "Zebedee stories."

I'd counter that, first, the book is bookended by two major self-referencing Zebedee stories that make it very clear the author is John, and second, this source doesn't seem to be aware that a general avoidance of many of the incidents involving John ben Zebedee that other gospels freely report is a big part of exactly what we would expect if it was written by John in their culture.

It's really that the book tells *different* "Zebedee stories" (instances of association with Peter especially) from the other gospels, which makes sense if the author is one son of Zebedee.

It's argued that the host would sit next to the chief guest (Jesus) at the Last Supper, but this was evidently in Jerusalem, not Bethany; why would Lazarus be the host in Jerusalem?

It's then argued it wasn't Jerusalem after all, but Bethany, but then why did Jesus go so far to the garden of Gethsemane, which is thought to be right next to Jerusalem, while Bethany is much further away?

We're told in John 12 that Jesus was in Bethany, and then comes to Jerusalem, with the triumphal entry, then the Last Supper begins. Is Judas expected to travel all the way at night from Bethany to Jerusalem, and Jesus and his disciples nearly all the way, then Judas first checks Gethsemane? Or did the arresting crowd go all the way to Bethany, and then, failing to find Jesus, all the way to Gethsemane?

It makes much more sense to me if Jesus is in Jerusalem, and Judas and the arresting crowd go first to where in Jerusalem Jesus had been when Judas left, and then Judas has them check Gethsemane, while Bethany would be the last priority to check, and a moot point once they found them in Gethsemane.

Luke 22:8-10 also seems to clearly say it was in Jerusalem, although it only says "the city," so is Bethany "the city"? That seems unlikely when Jerusalem itself is an option.

And why all this wording that seems like the arrangement for the upper room is some place they aren't already familiar with, if in fact it's Lazarus' home in Bethany?

It also seems to be only with the Twelve. Here's the passage:

<blockquote><span class="bbq">/Luke 22:8 Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat.”<br><br>

9 They said to him, “Where do you want us to prepare?”<br><br>

10 He said to them, “Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters. 11  Tell the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?” ’ 12  He will show you a large, furnished upper room. Make preparations there.”<br><br>

13 They went, found things as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover.<br><br>

14 When the hour had come, he sat down with the twelve apostles.</span></blockquote>

See also [Mark 14:12-17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mar/14/12){:target="_blank"}, [Matthew 26:17-20](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mat/26/17){:target="_blank"}. They also mention "the city" and that he would recline at the table with the twelve, not with the owner of the house. The message to the owner seems to clearly explain that it would just be Jesus and the Twelve. It's possible others were present, including the owner, though. But it seems clear it's in Jerusalem, and that the disciples would be next to Jesus, not others.

John also says in 18:1 that they went to the "other side" of the Kidron Valley, to the garden. Checking a map quickly, Kidron is between Jerusalem and Gethsemane. It isn't between Bethany and Gethsemane.

So yes, it was Jerusalem, not Bethany, so whoever the host was, it seems it can't have been Lazarus. And if the host was there, whoever it was could have been on Jesus' other side from John.

It's argued that John doesn't include the prayer at Gethsemane, because only Peter, James, and John, supposedly, were there.

But this assumes that listing a group means that only that group is present, which contradicts the previous argument (ironically made by the same person), and would prevent Lazarus from being the unnamed disciple who was at the arrest in Gethsemane and went with Peter to the trial and is the one who was known to the high priest. This argument would require that this could only be James or John.

And it seems clear that more than just those three were there. Mark likely was, and I think probably the twelve (minus Judas). (Though this arguer may have meant that others were there but not as close, which does seem to be intended by Mark 14:32-33.)

As for why John doesn't repeat the prayer, if he's writing a supplemental gospel, why should he repeat it?

It's already covered in Mark, which JPH says there's evidence John was especially intended to write a supplement to. (Which in turn is evidence for John, as one of the other top disciples long-term in addition to Peter, who Mark was a student of.) So John would especially not likely see a need to rehash it, and the author of John would already know it from Mark, even if he hadn't personally witnesses it, so could have included it. If the author is Lazarus, he already had to include many things he didn't likely witness.
