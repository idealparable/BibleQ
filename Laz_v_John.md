# BibleQ: Lazarus Versus John

Bible Question (BibleQ): Who is the disciple Jesus loved? Lazarus? Or the apostle John? And who wrote the gospel of John?

---
## Relevance? Introduction / Summary
---

I was asked if this question matters. It does, to a lot of subjects I focus on, especially apologetics topics and general interpretation issues. Some examples below.

None of these are absolutely essential, but some of them are about as close as you can get.

--- 
### Relevant to Trinity
---
The relevance I see as closest to crucial relates to one of our strongest lines of support for the Trinity, that it's taught in Genesis 1-2, using a premise of John as both the disciple Jesus loved and author of the gospel of John.

Since Jesus focused on "from the beginning" as an important doctrinal tool to discern what in the Law of Moses still stands for Christians (e.g. Matthew 19:8), an emphasis Paul also taught in Romans 1 (likely following Christ's taught emphasis to his disciples, then passed on to Paul), it seems that the very well-studied students of Christ (John) and of his apostles (Mark, student of Peter) looked very closely at Genesis and noticed the phrasing that clearly implies these two things:

- First, that Christ himself, the beginningless Son of God, or Word (Logos) of God as Philo also says (an extrabiblical NT-era Jewish source), authored Genesis 1 through 2:3.

  And likely 2:4 as closing signature line (containing the word "toledoth," sometimes thought to merely mean generations, but likely means "account"), though one prominent interpreter of Genesis, Jonathan Sarfati, in his book *The Genesis Account*, credibly argues, (although I think unsuccessfully), that all such lines go with the sections following them, not before them, and are likely merely transitional statements by Moses, though he acknowledges Moses may have used sources.

  I think that Moses likely compiled accounts, possibly accurately preserved from memory originally prior to the invention of writing, and this seems to be explicitly confirmed in the case of the toledoth line in Genesis 5, which adds that it is the "book of" the toledoth of Adam, which likely should be read as implied to apply to all the other toledoth lines too.

- Second, I think the apostle John, Mark, and other early Christians likely noticed that Christ modeled what I've been calling "authorial avoidance" as an optional way to approach self-referential statements by an author in his own work.

  I'm not sure if I got that term from others or if there is a standard term for it, but this was a way authors could avoid seeming to claim too much *personal* honor, as in their culture they believed in a "limited honor" model, that honor (acclaim, likeliness of resources being directed your way, etc.) was a finite resource that had to be allocated.

  This is part of why it's clear right in Genesis 1-2 that "the LORD God" has a *personal* distinction from the one called simply "God" earlier, even though it's also clear the two terms can be used interchangeably or at least cooperatively ()

  This is important as it answers Unitarian-style objections that the Trinity is a late invention, or at earliest a Christian objection. It's known that Jews in the Inter-Testamental (IT) period did think there might be "Two Powers" in heaven, identified as internal numbering, within God's nature, while God is outwardly one.

  I see in this evidence that the "three Persons in one Being" belief of Trinitarianism is actually evidenced right in Genesis, and clearly noticed by the author of the gospel of John in John 1.

  Most later authors of portions of Scripture, including the other "toledoth sections," just referred to themselves in the third person, only rarely clarifying in-text that they're the ones authoring it.

  This seems to be the other way they avoid seeming to claim too much personal honor, probably motivated based on the toledoth lines originally as oral accounts, later likely written in tablets and on skins (clay tablets are common to the Ancient Near East, typically with the signature lines at the end (colophons), and Jewish extrabiblical sources say that Moses wrote on animal skins; this may have been an early Egyptian tradition, which I think Abraham also adopted, as he visited Egypt and the section I think was authored by him), and eventually papyrus.

  Note: I'm saying these individuals likely "authored" sections of Genesis, not "wrote" per se.

  Writing, or at least drawing symbols as memory aids, may have developed sooner than is popularly thought, possibly present from the start with Adam, maybe even part of the built-in language knowledge Adam was created with, or taught by the pre-incarnate Christ to Adam along with telling Adam His account of the parts of creation Adam hadn't yet been there to witness, and His perspective of the ones he had.

  Although the evidence for development of alphabetic writing specifically post-Babel is strong. Tim Mahoney of Patterns of Evidence even suggests it was a Hebrew innovation. Or they may have helped to popularize it more than others.

  Even if the pre-Babel or pre-Flood authors of toledoth sections had no form of writing or mnemonic drawings yet, keep in mind that genetic degradation increases over time, not the other way around, and even today some have photographic memories. This likely would have been universal and later still near-universal, plus generations often overlapped more to hear it from the author directly.

  Adam's life for example overlapped everyone in Noah's lineage except Noah himself, in the Masoretic Text (MT) version of the genealogies which our modern Bibles use, and from my study is most likely correct over and against the Septuagint (LXX) or Samaritan Pentateuch (SP).

We can support the Trinity in many other ways other ways, including most of this, but the premise of John as authorially-avoiding with the "disciple loved" phrasing in his gospel is part of the support.

Without this premise, a Unitarian can make it look more plausible that the Trinity is "out of the blue" when its clearest passages come in the New Testament, or, as many Unitarians do, they could argue that these passages themselves can't mean what they seem to mean to Trinitarians.

We can still argue for the "us-texts" in Genesis as teaching plurality of internal nature of God in some way, and Unitarian arguments against this evidence have indeed been soundly debunked.

Mainly they argue it refers to angels, which the wording forbids as the "us" does the creating, and we're explicitly told God does the creating, not angels.

And one (Sean Finnegan) argues based on the parcity of these "us" wordings (only three indisputable, all in Genesis, arguably a fourth in Isaiah) compared to unipersonal pronouns, which is irrelevant since most of these are referring to the Son or to the Father or to the Spirit rather than the Being, and some even backfire on the Unitarian (e.g. the Father calling the Son "you" in Psalm 110).

And the three initial us-texts serve as prior context clarifying all later phrasing, so it didn't need to be spelled out explicitly over and over, which is foreign to their high-context culture.

But if in fact the details of the opening, avoided self-referential naming, and authorship of John (the gospel) mean what I think they mean, then the Trinity specifically (as three actually listed Persons, not just a vague plurality with unspecified number) was taught using the rules of Hebrew right to Adam, and was always understood by all later authors and readers as foundational.

### Other Relevances
---
Beyond this one relevance, the identity of the disciple Jesus loved might not be as crucial, but it does have apologetics and proper interpretation relevance in other ways.

- The identity of the author as John does matter to skeptical objections to the authorship of all four gospels. The evidence best fits that the scroll tags of all four were the titles and author signatures, and this is universally attested.

The fact that Mark also is apparently the one not named in the gospel of Mark evidences that this was a trend among Jesus' disciples, so most likely the "disciple Jesus loved" phrasing is John's own way of adopting this, and that he uses the similar style in his epistles, and when paraphrasing the messengers from Mary and Martha about Lazarus' sickness.

- John's use of Greek is also said to be better than Peter's, evidencing a better-then-usual education, perhaps because his father may have been a somewhat wealthier fisherman than others, and his theology is very advanced, making it plausible that he's the one who was known to the chief priest.

- One argument made for identifying Lazarus as the disciple loved is relevant to a key to proper biblical interpretation in general -- how Hebrews specified literal "all" statements (what I often abbreviate "literall" with non-literal all).

  For literal all, they would typically need to repeat "all" or synonyms at least twice, in close proximity.

  - For example, this is relevant to why we see Genesis as teaching a global Flood.

    Aside from abundant geological and other scientific sound support of this (see Answers in Genesis (AiG), Creation Ministries International (CMI), Institute of Creation Research (ICR), and the Creation Research Society (CRS)), statements meaning "all" are said many, many times in Genesis about the extent of the flooding. If you don't realize that you might think a local Flood is plausible. This helps make it clear that the Bible is scientifically testable.

    An Old-Earther, or someone who hasn't studied the topic, may think that's a problem for Christians, as populist Old-Eartherism and evolutary origins of atheistic, deistic, or agnostic alternatives to miraculous special creation are claimed by the ill-informed to be strongly scientifically supported.

    However, literally-all major (and the vast majority of obscure) arguments for that claim have been soundly debunked, and the sound support of biblical creation is extremely strong.

    Here, the same "paragraph" (very close sentences part of a single longer statement) has the multiple uses of "all."

  - The rules of "all" are also relevant to debunkings of countless accusations of Bible contradictions.

    One is directly related to Lazarus v. John as Matthew has Jesus saying that "all" the disciples scattered, then a few verses later says that Peter followed at a distance.

    It's argued that the disciple Jesus loved, who helped Peter access the courtyard where he would deny Christ when asked, "cannot" be John, since John is a disciple, and even Jesus himself had earlier said they would scatter "each" to his own home.

    This is problematic since, obviously, the very phrase in question is "the disciple whom Jesus loved," yet this argument would be saying Lazarus isn't a disciple, so could be the one letting Peter into that courtyard. But it also goes against the rules for how "all" works in the biblical-eras Hebrew language and culture (including when they express it in Aramaic or Greek, or any other language).

    In the Laz v John passages I saw so far in checking before writing this introduction, I saw "all"-statements only used once within-statement.

    A proponent of Lazarus as the disciple loved could argue that since there are multiple such statements (such as at least two in Matthew), that my argument here actually backfires.
    
    But as far as I've seen so far, these are in different statements. In the Matthew cases I saw, many other passages and events are between the two.

    I recently saw mentioned in a random article (that I didn't take a note about), I believe it was from CMI, that one scholar has claimed that merely two repetitions would be enough for a literal, absolute all. I don't know if that's true, and if we find two later relevant to Laz v John, that argument would become much stronger.

    But I haven't done a whole Bible survey to test this claim, and it seems to me that it's more likely that there could be nonliteral-all repeats that give emphasis, and that the logic supporting cases of literal-all need to look more closely at the logic flow in the passages and compare to the whole Bible on a case by case basis.

    For example, I wouldn't at all be surprised if Jesus had said, "all all you" will fall away, as he's being "in your face" about the surprise they might feel at that prediction at the time. This could be to emphasize how emotional the situation was and how ashamed they might feel that they did scatter like that, rather than a trivial quibble about precisely how many of them did so.

    Also, "following at a distance" does seem to mean Peter and the disciple loved "scattered" but then stayed distant.

    That especially makes sense because Peter had just attacked these very arresting forces, cutting Malchus' ear. He wouldn't likely be keen to be walking right with them. I see this as consistent with "scattering."

    In any case, if we take this Lazarus-as-disciple-loved argument seriously, that it can't be John because he's the disciple (and if we somehow work our way out of the problem of "the disciple is not a disciple"), to be consistent it should be applied to the entirety of the rest of scriptural interpretation, and then the problems are too numerous to count.

## Pro JonDiAuth:

/[Jhn 13:34-36 LSB] 34 **"A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another.**

35 **"By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another."**/


This is at the end of the first section to feature the DiscipleLoved phrase (where DiscipleLoved is asked by Pete to ask Jesus who the betrayer would be).


I think most likely Johnzeb took these words vividly to heart at this time, and is both DiscipleLoved and Auth. This would explain:

- Why the theme of love, and God loving, being love, and Christians loving each other is so common in the three epistles of John.

- Why the Disciple phrasing and similar HeLoved, Beloved, and just general focus on the word "love" are so common in GOJ, less so in other gospels and biblical books. This is a mark of JohnZeb's personal style.

- Why the content of the message to Jesus about Lazarus' death contained HeLoved; remember there were no quote marks and this is not necessarily or likely a direct quote. It's more likely Auth's own phrasing summarizing the gist of what the messengers said. I think
