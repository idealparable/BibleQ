# BibleQ: Lazarus Versus John

**Bible Question (BibleQ):** Who is the disciple Jesus loved? Lazarus? Or the apostle John? And who wrote the gospel of John?

## Relevance? Introduction / Summary
The identity of the disciple Jesus loved, and of the author of the gospel of John, are indirectly relevant to some very important topics in apologetics, theology, and proper biblical interpretation.

None of these relevances are absolutely essential, but some of them are about as close as you can get, including the Trinity and debunkings of supposed Bible contradictions.

Note: For this extended introduction I'll try to generally avoid my abbreviations which are defined after it ([here](#format-notes)), but note that Bible quotes are typically LSB version unless otherwise specified, and may be enclosed in slashes (like /In the beginning.../) instead of quote marks to indicate a Scriptural quote.

### Relevant to Trinity

The relevance I see as closest to crucial relates to one of our strongest lines of support for the Trinity, that it's taught in Genesis 1-2, using a premise of John as both the disciple Jesus loved and author of the gospel of John.

Specifically the argument is that some early Christians took Jesus' focus on Genesis ([Matthew 19:8](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mat/19/8)) as a reason to look closely at it as a pattern to follow, and that [Genesis 2:4](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/2/4) is a signature line for the preceding account, seeing Jesus as the LORD God there, implying he authored 1-2:3, using "authorial avoidance" of his own personal name within the account's body text itself, and that these early Christians used this model in some of their own works (Mark and John), despite millennia of a tradition of instead referring to oneself in the third person, since the apparent account of Adam from [2:5](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/2/5) through [5:1a](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/5/1), and Moses himself ([Exodus 17:14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/exo/17/14), [Numbers 33:1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/num/33/1),[2](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/num/33/2)), etc.

Though the 3rd-person option also remained valid, as Matthew uses it (compare [Matthew 9:9](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mat/9/9) with [Mark 2:14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mar/2/14) and [Luke 5:27](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/luk/5/27)). And sometimes first person as with Luke's openings of both [Luke](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/luk/1/3) and [Acts](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/act/1/1).

Also, probably not coincidentally, Mark was said (by Papias as quoted by Eusebius, and by Clement) to be a top student of Peter, and Peter and John were two of the three disciples normally treated as central (e.g. [Matthew 17:1-8](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mat/17/1)), and closest to Jesus. So basically they adopted what they saw as Jesus' own authorship style.

Here's the argument in more detail (above is a summary of the below written after it):

Since Jesus focused on "from the beginning" as an important doctrinal tool to discern what in the Law of Moses still stands for Christians (e.g. [Matthew 19:8](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mat/19/8)), an emphasis Paul also taught in Romans 1 (likely following Christ's taught emphasis to his disciples, then passed on to Paul), in [20](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/rom/1/20), [23](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/rom/1/23), [25](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/rom/1/25), [26](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/rom/1/26), [27](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/rom/1/27), it seems that the very well-studied students of Christ (John) and of his apostles (Mark, student of Peter) looked very closely at Genesis and noticed the phrasing that clearly implies these two things:

- First, that Christ himself, the beginningless Son of God, or Word (Logos) of God as Philo also says (an extrabiblical NT-era Jewish source), authored Genesis 1 through 2:3.

  And likely [2:4](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/2/4/s_1047020) as closing signature line (containing the word "toledoth," sometimes thought to merely mean generations, but likely means "account"), though one prominent interpreter of Genesis, Jonathan Sarfati, in his book *The Genesis Account*, credibly argues, (although I think unsuccessfully), that all such lines go with the sections following them, not before them, and are likely merely transitional statements by Moses, though he acknowledges Moses may have used sources.

  I think that Moses likely compiled accounts, possibly accurately preserved from memory originally prior to the invention of writing, and this seems to be explicitly confirmed in the case of the toledoth line in [Genesis 5:1a](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/5/1/s_1047020), which adds that it is the "book of" the toledoth of Adam, which likely should be read as implied to apply to all the other toledoth lines too.

  The perspectives match "sig-after" (toledoth lines as signatures after the accounts they go with) -- for example, only God witnesses creation before Day 6 -- up through the Abraham section, which has no toledoth, as the first one to be very long, so an end-signature first became less useful, then later shifted to usually sig-before.
  
  Sarfati seems to assume that they all have to be one or the other, but we don't do that with modern sources; some are after, some before, and as far as I've been able to find, nobody has ever supported a universal rule with any evidence at all.
  
  And the norm in clay tablets for short accounts in the Ancient Near East (ANE) is sig-after.
  
  Until the Abraham account, the sections were short enough to work for that, but the Abe account is much too long for it.

  The "signature" purpose may also have been Moses citing his source, rather than part of the original account per se, but that works out to the same thing (not merely a transitional statement).
  
  This could make sense if the accounts were originally oral, and whose account it was would be credited outside of the account itself, and later was added into attribution lines at the end of clay tablets (such end-sigs are called colophons), used as sources possibly by Moses, or at least the pattern of them could have been emulated by him.

  The only exception where this pattern doesn't seem initially to fit is in the Naamah genealogy in chapter 4, if Naamah is Noah's wife, as I think is clearly implied.
  
  Based on the number of names, and timing of similarities in styles in different eras between her and his genealogies (a common trend throughout biblical history), Naamah likely was born after the death of Adam.
  
  However, it's clear that genealogical information was later updated into earlier accounts by someone else in the chain of curation of the accounts (authors of later accounts in Genesis, or compiler if as late as Moses).
  
  This is seen most clearly in the two Esau genealogies ([36:1-8](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/36/1) listing his sons, then [9-43](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mat/19/8) repeating the list of his sons and adding other later descendants).
  
  Genealogies also usually start an account, establishing credentials of the author, so the style change from [4:17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/4/17) to 18 likely is the start of a later brief account of Naamah added by Noah, or kept separately and compiled in by Moses or any of the other curators between them, such as Shem.
  
  The style also changes back at [4:25](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/4/25), so this is likely Adam's authorship again, continuing through the /This is the book of the generations of Adam/ part ([5:1a](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/5/1)) of Genesis 5.

  Then a review summary of events from the earlier accounts is begun in 5:1b, also common after toledoth lines, indicating it is preserving an original account verbatim, not Moses merely using sources loosely. (Yet another basic point Sarfati does not even engage with.)

  In effect, Moses' use of these statements does turn them into transitions, but it's clear this is a lesser purpose.

  Also, the only case that looks like a transition is a major purpose is [Genesis 10:1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/10/1) (sons of "them" makes the last part clearly not the start of a later account, nor "the sons of Noah", and the first mention of the sons in the following verses has no break).
  
  This just happens to be the only one where the authorship, under the sig-after-until-Abe view, includes the same person (Shem) for the account both before and after.
  
  It's clear that before it, Shem was writing with help from Ham and Japheth, and after it he wrote his own contribution, so both would indeed have been a single account likely from the start, or he could have done the second one as an update and edited the original wording of what is now Genesis 10:1 (such an edit is much more likely for the original author than a later curator, given the clear evidence mentioned above that later curators/authors preserved prior accounts verbatim to a "fault").

  Early Christians following the "noble Berean" approach ([Acts 17:10-11](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/act/17/10)) would of course have read Genesis attentively and noticed these things, if they weren't already common knowledge in Judaism of the time (as they likely also were).

  Especially with Jesus' extra focus on Genesis as key.

- Second, I think the apostle John, Mark, and other early Christians likely noticed that Christ modeled what I've been calling "authorial avoidance" as an optional way to approach self-referential statements by an author in his own work -- by avoiding using his own name in Genesis 1-2:3.

  I'm not sure if I got that term from others or if there is a standard term for it, but this was a way authors could avoid seeming to claim too much *personal* honor, as in their culture they believed in a "limited honor" model, that honor (acclaim, likeliness of resources being directed your way, etc.) was a finite resource that had to be allocated.

  To be constantly reminding the reader that you were the person often in important events would seem to beat others over the head with how important you are, and that wasn't very appreciated.

  This is part of why it's clear right in Genesis 1-2 that "the LORD God" has a *personal* distinction from the one called simply "God" earlier, even though it's also clear the two terms can be used interchangeably or at least cooperatively (compare [1:27](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/1/27/s_1047020) & [2:7](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/2/7/s_1047020)).
  
  This is important as it answers Unitarian-style objections that the pluripersonality of God's internal nature yet singularity of his outward identity is a late invention.
  
  It's known that Jews in the Inter-Testamental (IT) period did at least think there might be "Two Powers" in heaven (conflating Son and Spirit to get two instead of three), identified as internal numbering, within God's nature, while God is one entity; these aren't separate beings, but have their own personalities or centers of consciousness.
  
  So "God is one" in the Shema ([Deuteronomy 6:4](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/deu/6/4), and related passages [Exodus 20:3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/exo/20/3), [Isaiah 43:10](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/isa/43/10), cf. [Mark 12:29](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mar/12/29)), meaning there are no other legitimate gods, yet internally some of his traits can be literally personified, without beginning.
  
  Specifically his wisdom (knowledge in action) and ideas which can be expressed as his word(s) for the Son (e.g. [Mark 1:1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mar/1/1), [Matthew 3:17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mat/3/17), [Matthew 8:20](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mat/8/20)) / Word ([John 1:1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/1/1), [14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/1/14)) / Wisdom (e.g. [Luke 11:49](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/luke/11/49), cf. [Matthew 23:34](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mat/23/34); [Proverbs 8:12](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/pro/8/12), [22-30](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/pro/8/22), [Proverbs 2:6](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/pro/2/6), [Matthew 11:16-19](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mat/11/16) / [Luke 7:31-32](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/luk/7/32), cf. [Proverbs 1:24-28](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/pro/1/24)) with focus on omnipotence (focus, not sole ability) (e.g. /word of his power/ in [Hebrews 1:3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/heb/1/3)), and his action capability (hand; [Ezekiel 1:3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/eze/1/3), [Deuteronomy 2:15](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/deu/2/15), [1st Samuel 12:15](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/1sa/12/15); cf. [Judges 3:10](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jdg/3/10), [Isaiah 61:1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/isa/61/1), [1st Peter 1:2](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/1pe/1/2); finger [Luke 11:20](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/luk/11/20), cf. [Matthew 12:28](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mat/12/28)) and thoughts ([John 16:13](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/16/13)) / emotions ([Romans 8:26](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/rom/8/26)) / understanding ([1st Corinthians 2:10-14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/1co/2/10), [14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/1co/2/14)) for the Spirit with focus on omnipresence (esp. in indwelling Christians (multiple people at once); e.g. [Acts 2:4](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/act/2/4), [Romans 8:9](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/rom/8/9); also [Psalm 139:7-8](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/psa/139/7)), while the Father focuses on omniscience/knowledge ([Exodus 31:3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/exo/31/3), [1st Peter 1:2](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/1pe/1/2), [Matthew 24:36](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mat/24/36), [Mark 13:32](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mar/13/32)) and ultimate authority ([John 8:28](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/8/28) / [5:19](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/5/19) / [16:13](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/16/13)) and as eternally, beginninglessly the source of the other two ([Hebrews 1:3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/heb/1/3) (read in context of [2](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/heb/1/2) and [5](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/heb/1/5)) / [John 8:42](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/8/42) / [Colossians 1:15-17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/col/1/15), [John 15:26](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/15/26) / [Hebrews 9:14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/heb/9/14)).

  Also the Spirit is mentioned within the account, as if prepared for action, but then not mentioned again, and all Scripture is inspired by the Spirit (the word for Spirit is also the word for wind or breath, so this is implied in [2nd Timothy 3:16](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/2ti/3/16/s_1128016); see also [2nd Peter 1:21](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/2pe/1/21/s_1157021), [Mark 12:36](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mar/12/36/s_969036)), so he has an implied authorial role too.
  
  He isn't the one signing the account, so he doesn't need to completely avoid being named in it, yet has a partial avoidance in avoiding clear mentions of what he did (he and the Son both acted in creating; carrying out the "let us" orders from the one called simply God, the Father).

  Thus, the Spirit has personal distinctions both from the one called simply "God" and from "the LORD God" (LSB Yahweh God).

  In this I see evidence that the "three Persons in one Being" belief of Trinitarianism is actually evidenced right in Genesis, and clearly noticed by the author of the gospel of John in John 1.

  Note that there would be no reason to avoid this personal reference if the author was the Father, as it's proper to attribute ultimate honor to him.

  Most later authors of portions of Scripture, including the other "toledoth sections," just referred to themselves in the third person, only rarely clarifying in-text that they're the ones authoring it.

  This seems to be the other way they avoid seeming to claim too much personal honor, probably motivated based on the need to use the toledoth lines as signatures for what were likely originally oral accounts, later likely written in tablets and on skins (clay tablets are common to the Ancient Near East, typically with the signature lines at the end (colophons), and Jewish extrabiblical sources say that Moses wrote on animal skins; this may have been an early Egyptian tradition, which I think Abraham also adopted, as he visited Egypt and the section I think was authored by him is the first very long one), and eventually papyrus.

  Note: I'm saying these individuals likely "authored" sections of Genesis, not "wrote" per se.

  Writing, or at least drawing symbols as memory aids, may have developed sooner than is popularly thought, possibly present from the start with Adam, maybe even part of the built-in language knowledge Adam was created with, or taught by the pre-incarnate Christ to Adam along with telling Adam His account of the parts of creation Adam hadn't yet been there to witness, and His perspective of the ones he had.

  Although the evidence for development of alphabetic writing specifically post-Babel is strong. Tim Mahoney of Patterns of Evidence even suggests it was a Hebrew innovation. Or they may have helped to popularize it more than others.

  Even if the pre-Babel or pre-Flood authors of toledoth sections had no form of writing or mnemonic drawings yet, keep in mind that genetic degradation increases over time, not the other way around, and even today some have photographic memories. This likely would have been universal and later still near-universal, plus generations often overlapped more to hear it from the author directly.

  Adam's life for example overlapped everyone in Noah's lineage except Noah himself, in the Masoretic Text (MT) version of the genealogies which our modern Bibles use, and from my study is most likely correct over and against the Septuagint (LXX) or Samaritan Pentateuch (SP).

We can support the Trinity in many other ways, including most of this, but the premise of John as authorially-avoiding with the "disciple loved" phrasing in his gospel is part of the support.

Without this premise, a Unitarian can make it look more plausible that the Trinity is "out of the blue" when (most of) its clearest passages come in the New Testament, or, as many Unitarians do, they could argue that these passages themselves can't mean what they seem to mean to Trinitarians.

Or a biblioskeptic could even argue that the clear Trinitarian teaching in the NT is inconsistent with the OT's supposed lack of clarity on it.

We often answer that God can reveal more about his nature over time, which is true, but to be fair, it would indeed seem weird that such a basic that's so important to his nature wouldn't be taught right away.

If I'm right about John, then it was, and John noticed.

If we take out the John premise, I'm not aware of much strong evidence for authorial avoidance as specific to Christ, so it becomes more of a stretch to use this to explain why the term "the LORD God" isn't used until 2:4, and the counter can seem more plausible that it's simply that 2:4 goes with what follows and this is just the new synonym for "God," or even to argue for the (generally otherwise debunked but still promoted stubbornly) populist skeptic Documentary Hypothesis / JEDP.

We could still argue for "the LORD God" as the author of 1-2:3, and 2:4 as a signature line based on all the clear evidence from Genesis, but it becomes unclear that the reason for the lack of that term earlier is about personal honor or authorial avoidance.

This is much clearer if John used authorial avoidance -- the same author who started his gospel with "In the beginning was the Word" and adds that he was the primary focus of creative power -- which might otherwise seem like surprising new revelation. Which is possible, but then the apparent total lack of early surprise or dispute of this teaching is, well, surprising. It makes much more sense if John was seeing this as taught in Genesis following Hebrew rules of interpretation in combination with Christ. Jesus may also have directly told him how this works, so that John would preserve very clear clues to it in his gospel.

We can still argue for the "us-texts" in Genesis as teaching plurality of internal nature of God in some way, and Unitarian arguments against this evidence have indeed been soundly debunked.

Mainly they argue it refers to angels, which the wording forbids as the "us" does the creating, and we're explicitly told God does the creating, not angels. Or some will argue for the "royal we" (plural of majesty) which Hebrew scholars reject as nonexistent for verbs and pronouns, so can't be used for "us," and that argument would prove too much, as it would imply only a plurality is actually majestic.

And one (Sean Finnegan) argues based on the rarity of these "us" wordings (only three indisputable, all in Genesis, arguably a fourth in Isaiah) compared to unipersonal pronouns, which is irrelevant since most of these are referring to the Son or to the Father or to the Spirit rather than the Being, and some even backfire on the Unitarian (e.g. the Father calling the Son "you" in Psalm 110 ([1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/psa/110/1) and most of the other verses "your", [4](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/psa/110/4) "you"); the Unitarian argument assumes that all such pronouns are literally *personal* pronouns, and that there is no such thing as a pronoun referring to the Being, which I don't assume, but if it's correct, it also means the "you" here has the Father referring to the Messiah as a distinct Person from the Father, and we know from many other OT passages that the Messiah would be God; see [Isaiah 9:6-7](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/isa/9/7), [Psalm 45:6-7](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/psa/45/6), [Micah 5:2](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mic/5/2), [Daniel 7:13-14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/dan/7/13),[27](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/dan/7/27)).

And the three initial us-texts ([Gen 1:26](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/1/26), [3:22](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/3/22), [11:7](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/11/7)) serve as prior context clarifying all later phrasing, so it didn't need to be spelled out explicitly over and over, which is foreign to their high-context culture.

But if in fact the details of the opening, avoided self-referential naming, and authorship of John (the gospel) mean what I think they mean, then the Trinity specifically (as three actually listed Persons, not just a vague plurality with unspecified number or sense) was taught using the rules of Hebrew right to Adam, and was always understood by all later authors and readers as foundational.

### Other Relevances

Beyond this one relevance, the identity of the disciple Jesus loved might not be as crucial, but it does have apologetics and proper interpretation relevance in other ways.

- The identity of the author as John does matter to skeptical objections to the authorship of all four gospels. The evidence best fits that the scroll tags of all four were the titles and author signatures, and this is universally attested.

- The fact that Mark also is apparently the one not named in the gospel of Mark ([14:51-52](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mar/14/51)) evidences that this was a trend among Jesus' disciples, so most likely the "disciple Jesus loved" phrasing is John's own way of adopting this, and that he uses the similar style in his epistles, and when paraphrasing the messengers from Mary and Martha about Lazarus' sickness.

- John's use of Greek is also said to be somewhat better than expected for a fisherman; while his vocabulary is simple, he constructed complex sentences using advanced imagery, and evidently wrote personally, as opposed to Peter who seems to have relied on scribes for his epistles.

  If correct, the evidence about Peter would help establish a potential "baseline" of expectations for fishermen, above which seems to have been John to some extent. I'll list some of it now.

  [1st Peter 5:12](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/1pe/5/12)) seems to confirm Silas/Silvanus was the scribe (amanuensis) for the first Petrine epistle; while [2nd Peter 3:1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/2pe/3/1) might by itself seem to imply it was by his own hand, it equates the first letter with being written by him too, showing that most likely he sees using a scribe as him "writing to" them, so that likely applies to the second letter too, although this is debated. Also, that Peter relied on Mark to write down his teachings evidences this, or at least a possible lesser knowledge of Greek specifically (he may have told them what to write in Aramaic, or Hebrew, although it's likely everyone knew some Greek).

  If these clues mean what they seem to mean, and if John really did write directly rather than using scribes, it may evidence a better-than-usual education, perhaps because his father may have been a somewhat wealthier fisherman than others, and his theology is very advanced, making it plausible that he's the one who was known to the high priest.

  That said, the line /we know that his witness is true/ ([John 21:24](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/21/24)) is taken by some to indicate the use of scribes, or that John's students wrote the final form of the gospel. I think more likely it's including the author's first-person affirmation that he knows what he says is true, and that of other witnesses whose presence has been mentioned, given that the very same verse confirms /This is the disciple who is bearing witness to these things and wrote these things/ and the next /I suppose/ (showing first-person writing).

  Also, in their culture, no writing was likely a solitary project; it's thought that it was normal for the author to be collaborating in discussing ideas of what to write next with others. So any statement I make about who apparently wrote a work needs to be understood in light of this caveat, that the specific word choice might not be solely his own even if he was the one physically writing. Also dictation to a scribe was normal even for the highly educated, as Paul himself says many times that he did.
  
  Still, it does seem that the author of John was somewhat closer to the physical writing and closer to being the sole intellectual source for the wordings than Peter.

  If we only had the gospel named after John, this might indeed seem like an argument for Lazarus, but in comparing it to the three Johannine epistles and the book of Revelation, all four also thought to be authored by John, it's very similar.

  For example, "love," a key word in the very phrase most at issue for this BibleQ, is a common theme and word in the three epistles and the gospel (especially [1st John 4:8](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/1jo/4/8) / [4:16](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/1jo/4/16) and [John 8:42](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/8/42) / [14:21](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/14/21),[23](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/14/23),[24](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/14/24) / [15:9](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/15/9),[13](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/15/13) and many others). Also found often are light (e.g. [1st John 1:5](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/1jo/1/5),[7](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/1jo/1/7) and [John 1:4-9](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/1/4)), life ([1st John 5:12](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/1jo/5/12) and [John 5:26](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/5/26) and surrounding 21-29 / [6:33-34](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/6/33) & surrounding 27-68), and truth ([2nd John 1:1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/2jo/1/1) / [3rd John 1:3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/3jo/1/3) and [John 4:23](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/4/23) which alludes to all three Persons re [14:6](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/14/6) / [1:17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/1/17)). Note also the lack of self-attribution in the epistles compared to others' epistles (although Revelation is self-attributed in its body text to John), the phrase /Word of Life/ in [1st John 1:1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/1jo/1/1) as an opening very similar to that about the Word in [John 1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/1), and many similar constructions.
  
   So this evidences that it was John, not Lazarus, who wrote the gospel of John, and the final chapter makes it clear that the author is the same person identified as the disciple Jesus loved ([John 21:20](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/21/20) /Peter, turning around, *saw the disciple whom Jesus loved... the one who also had leaned back on His bosom at the supper and said, "Lord, who is the one who betrays you?"/ [21](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/21/21) /So Peter seeing him *said to Jesus, “Lord, and what about this man?”/ -- Check also [22-23](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/21/22), then [24](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/21/24) /This is the disciple who... wrote these things/), who was one of those on the fishing boat there ([21:2](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/21/2), [7](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/jhn/21/7)) and the sons of Zebedee are mentioned there.

  This is consistent with John making it very clear it's likely him, without quite using his name directly, preserving authorial avoidance.

  While the list does mention two other unnamed disciples, one pro-Lazarus argument (see below) is premised on identifying him as *not* a disciple. This is problematic enough as it is, but even more so if the argument about the high priest is that Lazarus wasn't a fisherman, yet would have to have been on this fishing boat. Why?

  So it makes much more sense if this is the most famous son of Zebedee (having more reason to avoid drawing too much direct focus on his name to avoid seeming to claim too much personal honor for himself), on the fishing boat because he's a fisherman, and is the same one who essentially wrote the gospel attributed universally to him, and being known to the high priest.

  Another consideration I haven't seen mentioned much is the question of how the elites among the leaders survived -- not by fishing, not by farming, but by obtaining their food from others. It's possible "known to the high priest" is shorthand for simply being among those who have provided food to the elites, or that his father was known to those who did so, etc. The high priest might have personally known him this way, or the normal ancient practice of "embedding" one's servants in oneself ([Matthew 8:5-13](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/mat/8/5) / [Luke 7:2-10](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/luk/7/2) use "the centurion said" (in Matthew) interchangeably with those sent by him passing on messages from him (in Luke), [1st Corinthians 12:27](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/1co/12/27) and preceding verses starting at [12](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/1co/12/15)) may be at play here, and it could mean the high priest's servants knew (of?) John.

- One argument made for identifying Lazarus as the disciple loved is relevant to a key to proper biblical interpretation in general -- how Hebrews specified literal "all" statements (what I often abbreviate "literall" with non-literal all).

  For literal all, they would typically need to repeat "all" or synonyms at least twice, in close proximity.

  - For example, this is relevant to why we see Genesis as teaching a global Flood.

    Aside from abundant geological and other scientific sound support of this (see Answers in Genesis (AiG), Creation Ministries International (CMI), Institute of Creation Research (ICR), and the Creation Research Society (CRS)), statements meaning "all" are said many, many times in Genesis about the extent of the flooding. If you don't realize that you might think a local Flood is plausible. This helps make it clear that the Bible is scientifically testable.

    An Old-Earther, or someone who hasn't studied the topic, may think that's a problem for Christians, as populist Old-Eartherism and evolutary origins of atheistic, deistic, or agnostic alternatives to miraculous special creation are claimed by the ill-informed to be strongly scientifically supported.

    However, literally-all major (and the vast majority of obscure) arguments for that claim have been soundly debunked, and the sound support of biblical creation is extremely strong.

    Here, the same "paragraph" (very close sentences part of a single longer statement) has the multiple uses of "all."

  - The rules of "all" are also relevant to debunkings of countless accusations of Bible contradictions.

    One is directly related to Lazarus v. John as Matthew has Jesus saying that "all" the disciples scattered, then a few verses later says that Peter followed at a distance.

    It's argued that the disciple Jesus loved, who helped Peter access the courtyard where he would deny Christ when asked, "cannot" be John, since John is a disciple, and even Jesus himself had earlier said they would scatter "each" to his own home.

    This is problematic since, obviously, the very phrase in question is "the disciple whom Jesus loved," yet this argument would be saying Lazarus isn't a disciple, so could be the one letting Peter into that courtyard. But it also goes against the rules for how "all" works in the biblical-eras Hebrew language and culture (including when they express it in Aramaic or Greek, or any other language).

    In the Laz v John passages I saw so far in checking before writing this introduction, I saw "all"-statements only used once within-statement.

    A proponent of Lazarus as the disciple loved could argue that since there are multiple such statements (such as at least two in Matthew), that my argument here actually backfires.
    
    But as far as I've seen so far, these are in different statements. In the Matthew cases I saw, many other passages and events are between the two.

    I recently saw mentioned in a random article (that I didn't take a note about), I believe it was from CMI, that one scholar has claimed that merely two repetitions would be enough for a literal, absolute all. I don't know if that's true, and if we find two later relevant to Laz v John, that argument would become much stronger.

    But I haven't done a whole Bible survey to test this claim, and it seems to me that it's more likely that there could be nonliteral-all repeats that give emphasis, and that the logic supporting cases of literal-all need to look more closely at the logic flow in the passages and compare to the whole Bible on a case by case basis.

    For example, I wouldn't at all be surprised if Jesus had said, "all all you" will fall away, as he's being "in your face" about the surprise they might feel at that prediction at the time. This could be to emphasize how emotional the situation was and how ashamed they might feel that they did scatter like that, rather than a trivial quibble about precisely how many of them did so.

    Also, "following at a distance" does seem to mean Peter and the disciple loved "scattered" but then stayed distant.

    That especially makes sense because Peter had just attacked these very arresting forces, cutting Malchus' ear. He wouldn't likely be keen to be walking right with them. I see this as consistent with "scattering."

    In any case, if we take this Lazarus-as-disciple-loved argument seriously, that it can't be John because he's the disciple (and if we somehow work our way out of the problem of "the disciple is not a disciple"), to be consistent it should be applied to the entirety of the rest of scriptural interpretation, and then the problems are too numerous to count.

## Format Notes:
For the following detailed sections going through specific passages, **please do first read** these notes on format and abbreviations:

### Bible Citations
- Bible quotes may be enclosed in slashes (e.g. /In the beginning.../), especially if extended.
- Copypasted from Blue Letter Bible (BLB).
- Usually Legacy Standard Bible version (LSB) unless otherwise specified. See [here](https://www.blueletterbible.org/bibles/preface-to-the-legacy-standard-bible.cfm) for their format notes.
- I may put LSB italicized words (words not in the source) in square brackets ("[]") for .txt files.
- Citation formats may also be in square brackets (auto-generated by BLB).
- Quoted parallel fragments separated by slash (e.g. /expanse / heavens/).
- Extended quotes of extrabiblical sources may be delimited with "\|" (pipe) characters. Curly brackets "{}" could also be used; pipe has to be escaped with backslash in this coding format (Markdown, with some HTML) indicating a literal character rather than a table.
- The LSB has some limitations of general permission to quote, such as only up to a thousand quotes in one work ([see details here](https://lsbible.org/permission-to-quote-the-lsb/)). So for extended quotes or whole-Bible-study articles, I may use instead the [World English Bible](https://ebible.org/web/GEN01.htm), as a decent modern [Public Domain](https://ebible.org/web/copyright.htm) version (WEBP, don't confuse with Webster's Bible (WEB), although WEBP is sometimes called WEB too). So I may use that instead, or partially, likely with specification. Other versions may be quoted or cited, with specification.
- LSB as represented on BLB uses inline "[fn]" links to footnotes as popups. When I copypaste from BLB LSB, I will preserve these, as an indicator you can go to BLB to see what the popup says (and so I don't have to manually edit each such quote). These are placed before the word or phrase they apply to. However, I will not typically be quoting the footnotes here.
- LSB requires web pages that use quotes of LSB to include the following copyright notice:
"Scripture quotations taken from the (LSB®) Legacy Standard Bible®, Copyright © 2021 by The Lockman Foundation. Used by permission. All rights reserved. Managed in partnership with Three Sixteen Publishing Inc.  [LSBible.org](https://lsbible.org/) and [316publishing.com](https://316publishing.com/)."
Note: "For web pages or apps the full copyright notice must be used with www.LSBible.org being a click-enabled web link."

### Abbreviations:
- **Jhn** = John, the apostle, son of Zebedee, or the gospel of John (using BLB's book abbreviations), or perhaps a generic abbreviation for anybody named John such as the Baptist.
- **Jon / Jonzeb / Johnzeb** = Alternate abbreviations of the apostle John specifically. I use viewpoint abbreviations designed to be both fast to type and easy to say and understand when spoken; "Jon" will be used for that unless part of an abbreviation for another John like Jonbap for John the Baptist (read on). The other two may be used as shorthand in text.
- **Laz** = Lazarus
- **GOJ** = Gospel of John (using type of acronym where every word's first letter is capitalized, even for "of")
- **Di / DiLoved / DiscipleLoved** = Disciple Jesus Loved
- **HeLoved** = He whom Jesus Loved (Lazarus in Jhn 11:1-3)
- **Beloved** = anyBody Jesus Loved (esp. Christians; see first cite below, Jhn12:34-36)
- **Auth / Author** = Author of Gospel of John (specifically, when used in viewpoint abbreviations / etc., although authorship of the sections of Genesis are also relevant; I'll try to avoid the noun form of author for those).
<br><br>
- **Bap / Jonbap** = John the Baptist
- **Bapdad** = Zechariah, father of John the Baptist
- **Jonpete** = John the father of the apostle Peter
- **Pete** = Peter
<br><br>
- **Stu** = Student(s). Pronounced like stew.
- **Src** = Source (potentially one source among many for Auth). Abbreviation can be pronounced rhyming with "purse".
- **Foc** = Focus / focal point. Pronounced rhyming with "yoke".
<br><br>
- **Gen** = Genesis
- **GenFirst** = Genesis First Section (chapter 1 through 2:4, or through only 2:3 if 2:4 actually goes with the next section)
- **Tol** = Toledoth
- **Tol2** = Toledoth line in Genesis chapter 2 (Genesis 2:4)
- **Tol5** = Toledoth line in Genesis chapter 5 (Genesis )
- **Sig** = Signature
- **Seg** = Segue
- **Aft** = After
- **Pre** = Before
- **SpiGod** = Spirit of God (Holy Spirit as referred to in GenFirst)
- **GodFirst** = the one called simply God in GenFirst (also Genesis chapter 1); the Father on Trinitarianism.
- **LordGod / YahGod** = the LORD God in Genesis 2:4 (Tol2) and later (as rendered in many translations with LORD in all caps for the tetragammation YHWH as opposed to Adonai; LSB renders Yahweh God but I'm accustomed to LordGod. In my abbreviation I won't all-cap Lord due to my normal abbreviation rules.)
- **PreIncChrist** = Pre-Incarnate Christ
<br><br>
- **ANE** = Ancient Near East
- **MT** = Masoretic Text
- **LXX/70** = Septuagint (the Seventy)
- **SP** = Samaritan Pentateuch
- **AiG** = Answers in Genesis (don't confuse with AIG the insurance group with a capital I; here I'm using standard abbreviation format with i for "in" uncapitalized since it's a preposition, using normal title capitalization rules)
- **CMI** = Creation Ministries International (of creation.com)
- **ICR** = Institute of Creation Research
- **CRS** = Creation Research Society
<br><br>
- **literall** = literal-all
- **nonliterall** = non-literal all
<br><br>
- **LazVJon / Laz v Jon** = abbreviation for the topic, or the question
- **BibleQ** = Bible Question. I use this to refer to both my own notes about such questions when I try to do a thorough investigation and put my findings into a somewhat readable format, and to the questions themselves. Don't confuse with "Q" the spurious claimed "missing gospel" or source by biblioskeptic pseudoscholarship. Mnemonic pun on "barbecue / BBQ".

#### Main Viewpoint Options:
- ***JonDiAuth*** = Jonzeb as both DiscipleLoved and Author
- **LazDi** = Lazarus as DiscipleLoved (esp. encompassing both main variants on whether he's also Author of GOJ, or allowing John to be Author)
- **LazDiJonAuth** = Lazarus as DiscipleLoved, Jonzeb as Author (extremely problematic)
- **LazDiAuth** = Lazarus as both DiscipleLoved and Author (highly unlikely but some endorse)
- **JonAuth** = Jonzeb as Author
- **JonDi** = Jonzeb as DiscipleLoved
- **LazAuth** = Lazarus as Author

#### Other Options:
- **JonDiLazAuth** = Jonzeb as DiscipleLoved, Lazarus as Author (nobody seems to think this?)
- **JonStuAuth** = Some think Jonzeb wrote some content used as sources his Students put as GOJ
- **JonAuthLazSrc** (JonDiAuth variant) = John as Author using Lazarus as a Source
- ***JonAuthLazFoc*** (JonDiAuth variant) = John as Author with Lazarus as a Focus (most likely)

The options that I think are best-supported are in italics in the lists above.

## Pro JonDiAuth:

/[Jhn 13:34-36 LSB] 34 **"A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another.**

35 **"By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another."**/


This is at the end of the first section to feature the DiscipleLoved phrase (where DiscipleLoved is asked by Pete to ask Jesus who the betrayer would be).


I think most likely Johnzeb took these words vividly to heart at this time, and is both DiscipleLoved and Auth. This would explain:

- Why the theme of love, and God loving, being love, and Christians loving each other is so common in the three epistles of John.

- Why the Disciple phrasing and similar HeLoved, Beloved, and just general focus on the word "love" are so common in GOJ, less so in other gospels and biblical books. This is a mark of JohnZeb's personal style.

- Why the content of the message to Jesus about Lazarus' death contained HeLoved; remember there were no quote marks and this is not necessarily or likely a direct quote. It's more likely Auth's own phrasing summarizing the gist of what the messengers said. I think
