**Question(s):** QuestionGoesHere



(Bible quotes may be from [World English Bible Public domain version (WEBP)](https://ebible.org/web/GEN01.htm), or [Legacy Standard Bible (LSB)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/1/1) (links will usually be to LSB on Blue Letter Bible (BLB)), may be enclosed in slashes without spaces (e.g. /In the beginning.../), preserving existing quote marks. Slashes wih spaces may go between parallel quotes / fragments / cites / etc. Extrabiblical quotes may be enclosed in "|" (pipe) characters (example |...the founder of the name...|).  See [end notes](#end-notes) for details, copyright notices, and explanations of common abbreviations.)

# End Notes:
For the following detailed sections going through specific passages, **please do first read** these notes on format and abbreviations:

### Bible Citations
- Bible quotes may be enclosed in slashes (e.g. /In the beginning.../), especially if extended.
- Quotes from extrabiblical sources may be enclosed in "\|" (pipe) characters (example |)
- Copypasted from Blue Letter Bible (BLB).
- For shorter pages on this site, Bible version will usually be Legacy Standard Bible version (LSB) unless otherwise specified. See [here](https://www.blueletterbible.org/bibles/preface-to-the-legacy-standard-bible.cfm) for their format notes.
- I may put LSB italicized words (words not in the source) in square brackets ("[]") for easy .txt file copying of my content (.txt files, of the Windows Notepad app, take up very little space to store, but don't preserve italics, bold, etc.).
- Citation formats may also be in square brackets (auto-generated by BLB).
- Quoted parallel fragments separated by slash (e.g. /expanse / heavens/).
- Extended quotes of extrabiblical sources may be delimited with "\|" (pipe) characters. Curly brackets "{}" could also be used; pipe has to be escaped with backslash in this coding format (Markdown, with some HTML) indicating a literal character rather than a table.
- The LSB has some limitations of general permission to quote, such as only up to a thousand quotes in one work ([see details here](https://lsbible.org/permission-to-quote-the-lsb/)). So for extended quotes or whole-Bible-study articles, I may use instead the [World English Bible](https://ebible.org/web/GEN01.htm), as a decent modern [Public Domain](https://ebible.org/web/copyright.htm) version (WEBP, don't confuse with Webster's Bible (WEB), although WEBP is sometimes called WEB too). So I may use that instead, or partially, likely with specification. Other versions may be quoted or cited, with specification.
- LSB as represented on BLB uses inline "[fn]" links to footnotes as popups. When I copypaste from BLB LSB, I will preserve these, as an indicator you can go to BLB to see what the popup says (and so I don't have to manually edit each such quote). These are placed before the word or phrase they apply to. However, I will not typically be quoting the footnotes here.
- LSB requires web pages that use quotes of LSB to include the following copyright notice:
"Scripture quotations taken from the (LSB®) Legacy Standard Bible®, Copyright © 2021 by The Lockman Foundation. Used by permission. All rights reserved. Managed in partnership with Three Sixteen Publishing Inc.  [LSBible.org](https://lsbible.org/) and [316publishing.com](https://316publishing.com/)."
Note: "For web pages or apps the full copyright notice must be used with www.LSBible.org being a click-enabled web link."
