([Skip to answer](#answer) if you're familiar with my standard "must read" notes below. Otherwise you must read the must-read notes.)

## Must-Read Notes:
**If you know my real name, do not tell others.** I don't agree with giving out personal information online. You may refer to me by my email address, [**idealparable@gmail.com**](mailto:idealparable@gmail.com){:target="_blank"}.

Bible quotes may be from [World English Bible Public domain version (WEBP)](https://ebible.org/web/GEN01.htm){:target="_blank"}, or [Legacy Standard Bible (LSB)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lsb/gen/1/1){:target="_blank"} (links will usually be to LSB on Blue Letter Bible (BLB)).

**Bible quotes may be enclosed in slashes** without spaces (e.g. /In the beginning.../), preserving existing quote marks. Slashes with spaces may go between parallel quotes / fragments / cites / etc.

Extrabiblical quotes may be enclosed in "\|" (pipe) characters (example \|...the founder of the name...\|).

Keep in mind for brevity my wording may sound more definite than intended. This site is devoted to careful, open-minded truthseeking, building soundly from the ground up, and to helping anyone interested learn the current global state of knowledge. I'll try, though, to clarify what is less or more certain with clear word choice.

See [end notes](#end-notes) for more about citation style, copyright notices, explanations of common abbreviations, and a little more about (ideally not) citing me or contacting me. Read those too when you finish reading the rest of this page, please, if you haven't before.

# End Notes:
### Bible Citations
- Bible quotes may be enclosed in slashes (e.g. /In the beginning.../), especially if extended.
- Copypasted from Blue Letter Bible (BLB).
- For shorter pages on this site, Bible version will usually be Legacy Standard Bible version (LSB) unless otherwise specified. See [here](https://www.blueletterbible.org/bibles/preface-to-the-legacy-standard-bible.cfm){:target="_blank"} for their format notes.
- I may put LSB italicized words (words not in the source) in square brackets ("[]") for easy .txt file copying of my content (.txt files, of the Windows Notepad app, take up very little space to store, but don't preserve italics, bold, etc.).
- Citation formats may also be in square brackets (when auto-generated by BLB).
- Quoted parallel fragments separated by slash (e.g. /expanse / heavens/).
- Extended quotes of extrabiblical sources may be delimited with "\|" (pipe) characters. Curly brackets "{}" could also be used; pipe has to be escaped with backslash in this coding format (Markdown, with some HTML) indicating a literal character rather than a table, but pipe looks much better.
- I may still use normal quote marks as well in some cases.
- The LSB has some limitations of general permission to quote, such as only up to a thousand quotes in one work ([see details here](https://lsbible.org/permission-to-quote-the-lsb/){:target="_blank"}). So for extended quotes or whole-Bible-study articles or ones that otherwise will likely quote from many books of the Bible open-endedly, I default to the [World English Bible](https://ebible.org/web/GEN01.htm){:target="_blank"}, as a decent modern [Public Domain](https://ebible.org/web/copyright.htm){:target="_blank"} version (WEBP, don't confuse with Webster's Bible (WEB), although WEBP is sometimes called WEB too). So I may use that instead, or partially, likely with specification. Other versions may be quoted or cited, with specification.
- LSB as represented on BLB uses inline "[fn]" links to footnotes as popups. When I copypaste from BLB LSB (or others), I will normally preserve these, as an indicator you can go to BLB to see what the popup says (and so I don't have to manually edit each such quote). These are placed before the word or phrase they apply to. However, I will not typically be quoting the footnotes here.
- LSB requires web pages that use quotes of LSB to include the following copyright notice:
"Scripture quotations taken from the (LSB®) Legacy Standard Bible®, Copyright © 2021 by The Lockman Foundation. Used by permission. All rights reserved. Managed in partnership with Three Sixteen Publishing Inc.  [LSBible.org](https://lsbible.org/){:target="_blank"} and [316publishing.com](https://316publishing.com/){:target="_blank"}."
Note: "For web pages or apps the full copyright notice must be used with www.LSBible.org being a click-enabled web link."

### Cite or Contact Me?
Please think twice about citing me as if I was an authoritative source. I'm just a nobody layman with a brain who's dying (hopefully of old age), so I wanted to know what would happen after, and what I should do about it. As should all. I happened to learn a lot, including a layman focus on logic. So in case it would help people I try to make what I know available to others, but you should be doing your own study.

If you want to cite me, you can refer to me by my email: [**idealparable@gmail.com**](mailto:idealparable@gmail.com){:target="_blank"}.

If you have questions, be aware I might not be very responsive at that email. I don't like to spend much time on one-on-one answers as that only directly goes to one person at a time. We have a whole globe of billions of people to be informed. But you can try if you must. It's a Charlie Brown mailbox, though, and unlike him, I usually don't bother checking. Expect delays.

**If you know my real name, do not tell others.** I don't agree with giving out personal information online.
