## Format Notes:
For the following detailed sections going through specific passages, **please do first read** these notes on format and abbreviations:

### Bible Citations
- Bible quotes may be enclosed in slashes (e.g. /In the beginning.../), especially if extended.
- Copypasted from Blue Letter Bible (BLB).
- Using Legacy Standard Bible version (LSB).
- I may put LSB italicized words in square brackets (words not in the source) for .txt files.
- Citation formats may also be in square brackets (auto-generated by BLB).
- Quoted parallel fragments separated by slash (e.g. /heaven / sky/).
- Extended quotes of extrabiblical sources may be delimited with "|" (pipe) characters.

### Abbreviations:
- **AbbrevGoesHere** = DefinitionGoesHere
<br><br>
- **TopicAbbrevGoesHere** = abbreviation for the topic, or the question
- **BibleQ** = Bible Question. I use this to refer to both my own notes about such questions when I try to do a thorough investigation and put my findings into a somewhat readable format, and to the questions themselves. Don't confuse with "Q" the spurious claimed "missing gospel" or source by biblioskeptic pseudoscholarship. Mnemonic pun on "barbecue / BBQ".

#### Main Viewpoint Options:
- ***BestViewAbbrevGoesHere*** = DefinitionGoesHere
- **AntiViewAbbrevGoeshere** = DefinitionGoesHere
- **OtherViewAbbrevGoeshere** = DefinitionGoesHere

#### Other Options:
- **ViewAbbrevGoesHere** = DefinitionGoesHere

The option or options that I think are best-supported are in italics in the lists above.
