# Bible is Anti-Slavery

**Bible Question:** Does the OT condone or allow slavery? What does "slavery" mean? What about NT? What's the objectively right strategy the Bible should use, why, and does it?

This is a save of what I typed up originally in Notepad, at first hoping to be merely posted as comments answering when a Christian asked me to review a bunch of (the usual) bad arguments by a particular skeptic (the typical type parroting the well-known modern "fundy atheist" talking points on slavery).

It quickly grew very long and the site where I would have tried to post it has a lot of problems with long comments. I could have tried to split it into many, but it doesn't handle that well.

So, I'm trying out just putting it here, to double as what I can refer to there, and an initial attempt at a page on it for here, since this is a topic I would have tried to write something up about here anyways; I've been asked about this a ton over the years and have done two whole-Law read-through notes-collecting studies on it, and read a lot else like from Glenn Miller (GM) of Christianthinktank on it (he collates scholarship findings).

As usual, I'm no authority on the subject, but the sound support I've found is very strong, and on its own is pretty clearly authoritative itself for an answer that actually, the Bible is explicitly anti-slavery in the OT Law of Moses.

And this would be prior context for the NT as well, so it didn't really need to repeat it.

Below I'll summarize some cautions about that related to Jesus' comments about the Law of Moses, but show why they don't override that this part of the OT Law's rejection of slavery likely still stands for the NT, but the Christians of the NT era simply weren't in any kind of a position of power to effect it.

Also bad logic claiming that Christians should have effected it much earlier if the Bible is against it is debunked, and various other (generally rather scammy) schemes of the skeptic in question, which in my experience are a clone of the entire mindset that many of them repeat lockstep (as if they are mind-slaves of their own elites).

Near the end I quote some key portions of Glenn Miller's main article on this where he builds a list of diagnostic features of slavery, suggest a few not in his bulletpoint section headers but mentioned along the way for the most part in his content, and summarize that list.

This is not intended to be thorough.

I do look at Leviticus 25 in-depth, but I have much else that could have been covered only alluded to or mentioned in passing, like my previous thorough parsings of the logic flow in Exodus 21.

This page may set a precedent that I might use for other situations where I've been meaning to cover a topic with a page on this site and someone brings it up so I write up replies. Rarely does that really work for this sort of thing, though, but this time it does. Some past re-usable-content sections have been made for posting elsewhere on common topics I could work on adapting too; we'll see.

After the usual must-read section below, under answer, I'll start immediately with the replies entirely copypasted from Notepad.

The format is designed for posting on that other site, not for here, since at first I hoped (in vain) that it would be short enough to easily just post there. There will be some markers for bold there that turn into italics here, or just won't work right maybe. I might reformat later.

FOR READERS DIRECTED HERE FROM THERE: Other pages and links on this site are almost entirely works in progress. There's really no other value to it yet for MOST topics other than a place I can put long replies on like this that the site where questions were raised doesn't work so well for a proper handling of in response.

Also note this isn't really a blog or anything else. More like my notes when they might help others who might miraculously have a vast reservoir of patience.

Otherwise I probably would have just tried to write a summary of my initial attempted reply that wouldn't have covered many of the points. There's value to that but I also end up feeling like I wasted time writing up a lot more that would benefit nobody (directly) but me. So this way I'm doing that, plus opening up the chance for maybe one or two others to get some benefit from it.

In my experience, skeptics love throwing a ton of worthless points in along with whatever handful might actually be good questions normal people might really wonder, intentionally so that if you cover them, they can whine about how long that forces the reply to be, if you don't thoroughly prove your answers they'll whine it should have been longer, and if you skip any points you felt many wouldn't take seriously, they can try to turn around the perception by claiming victory on them.

When I have time I like to TRY to just cover EVERYTHING and demonstrate a PROPER way to do it.

(If I do future examples like this, I won't, though, be over-explaining what this kind of page is and isn't like I am now in this intro. Just trying to be crystal clear for this first one; in my experience it may be wisest to do so at least once somewhere.)

Also note: Format options described in the must-read-notes below won't be used for the most part, other than that I'll delimit Bible quotes generally in slashes. Oh, and Bible version quoted is LSB in this case unless stated otherwise, not WEBP.

# Answer
1: Dunno about arguing from image to God against slavery, I don't think we would need that argument, but it would certainly make sense (certainly goes against the whole pumpkin insult of many historical slavers). If alluding to the idea that the Genesis pattern is instructive, Jesus teaches that, of course, and we at least don't see slaves there.

About Enlightenment I haven't studied that enough to be sure but I've seen many people claim they have and that it's really from the Bible, so the slow march of Christian reform etc.

2: Would have known so "could have" stopped it does absolutely nothing against arguments like what JP has argued that it would have been pushed against too much, making God's word even more often rejected -- which God would ALSO know even if the critic doesn't. ("Could have therefore should" is what I call potency error.)

Basically this simply blindly rejects what Jesus says about concessions to the hardhearted.

Or rejects its possible application here. But a whole-Law study (Sinai to Moses' death) shows that claims of what that section teaches are wildly off by skeptics in the first place. In fact in effect, Deuteronomy in effect DOES precisely what this skeptic demands!

LSB: /Deu 23:15 - “You shall not hand over to his master a slave who has [fn]escaped from his master to you. Deu 23:16 - “He shall live with you in your midst, in the place which he shall choose in one of your gates of the towns where it pleases him; you shall not mistreat him./

Other translation examples "You shall not wrong him" ESV "you must not oppress him" NET.

What would be the oppression or wronging here? It explicitly says it would be forcing an "ebed" (slave or servant, the term is categorical and skeptics have, some I've seen at least, like Digital Hammurabi, been forced to admit this applies to even foreign slaves -- not just servants) to stay with a master they don't want to.

That in essence is the modern sense of slavery that skeptics say God should declare to be wrong -- right here Moses is doing so in his speech (and document of it), reflecting what he believes is God's view based on what he knows from his abundant talks with God. (Hopefully we're all aware of the many passages say the latter.)

The skeptics who claim Sinai to MoDeath Law of Moses don't ban "slavery" are cheating by pretending other uses that ARE clearly only servants aren't banned. But since these aren't morally objectionable (not legitimately), it SHOULD NOT have banned those!

Again "ebed" simply means anybody under authority. So this just says, don't force ANYONE under authority (male version at least; ebed is male) to be what the modern term "slave" means.

Not that this talks about every aspect that was bad, like beating, and there are some arguments there as well, or the "you're like a pumpkin mere object property" thing. But it would COVER anything like that or more, since for WHATEVER reason the "male under authority" of any ethnicity or situation at all wants to leave the "master", they have the Law's support here.

In other words, skeptics are committing equivocation fallacy there.

One thing this doesn't address is why it allows buying of slaves from foreigners, but if that was banned, it would just leave those foreigners to be bought by other foreigners and stuck in slavery. So this is buy to free.

Also doesn't address why harsher "slavery" for war criminals, other criminals, may be allowed. (I would need to review passages on that off the top of my head but pretty sure it allows those somewhere.) But many skeptics also agree this one isn't as objectionable, and it's covered largely by how more difficult it was to have as reliable prisons like modern ones, and even today we often have prisoners do work. The harder work kept them tired so less likely to rebel.

One argument can be why does Moses wait until Deuteronomy to explicitly ban slavery. (I'll be here using JPH's definition of "slavery" but keep in mind we can figuratively use it of anyone under authority without endorsing any actual bad kind of being under authority. So Abraham can be a "slave" or "servant" to God, etc. Also some interesting things if anyone wants to look into it to see what I'm alluding to here about how LSB handles translation of ebed.)

However, the argument would backfire, because if slavery was okay, why would Moses ever ban it at all, and if it was wrong AND commonly PRACTICED (the latter two are in the skeptics' claim! we agree it's wrong but dispute the second of these two) by Israel (this is where things get complicated), then if he bans it at all, wouldn't it make more sense that he bans it right in Exodus?

Incidentally, he MIGHT! In Exodus 21. But if we grant for sake of argument that he doesn't -- and to be fair, this one is much clearer to a decontextualist, not that they are fair -- it makes much more sense that it wasn't as common in Israel (read on), so Moses knew the generations at that time didn't need it, but now that he was doing his speech sending them off knowing he was soon to die and they would found the nation, he needed to make it clear just in case future generations might not realize it's wrong which the former generations didn't need spelled out for them.

I said read on, for this: Would it have likely been common in Israel? Was it? Whether it WAS is beyond my ken. I originally thought it MIGHT have been likely due to a sort of "my enemies did this to me, I'll do this to my enemies in return" thing (enemies as "anybody not Israelite" in response to Egypt). However, it seems possibly just as likely that since they didn't like slavery themselves, if they generally treat foreigners well, that they would be very unlikely to do it. Obviously they didn't like slavery, and we have this:

/Lev 25:35 - ‘Now if a *brother* of yours becomes poor and his [fn]means with regard to you falter, then *you are to* sustain him, *LIKE a sojourner or a foreign resident,* that he may live with you./ Brother here likely means fellow Hebrew. (Probably extending to women too.) Bold and all-cap emphasis mine.

Read also through verse 48. (I'm looking at LSB here, which is free on Blue Letter Bible place on the global weblike thingy.) I'll copypaste it next. Sorry for how many comments that will make it.

/Lev 25:36 - ‘Do not take [fn]usurious interest from him, but fear your God, that your brother may live with you.
37 - ‘You shall not give him your silver at interest nor your food for gain./

At first we would think this means foreigners and Hebrews are to be treated exactly the same. However, we'll see that an exception on interest is spelled out. Skeptics will blindly assume that for something to be the SAME it must be spelled out, versus that everything is the same UNLESS it's spelled out, but we see tons of passages that make it clear the default is the same.

/Lev 25:38 - ‘I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God.

39 - ‘If a *brother* of yours *becomes so poor* with regard to you that he sells himself to you, *you shall not subject him to a slave’s service.*
40 - *‘He shall be* with you as a hired man, *as if he were a foreign resident;* he shall serve with you until the year of jubilee./

So twice we're told that treatment in general (at least in some way) of fellow Hebrews and foreigners is to be the same. There have been discussions on here in the past about the extent of the foreigners mentioned here. To keep this short, just keep that in mind. But it COULD suggest foreigners are in general treated the same. Exceptions are likely perks for signing onto the covenant, not justification of treating others wrongly.

So, I think that MUCH MORE likely, slavery was NOT common or maybe not even done among Israel, by modern definition. Continuing for full context:

/41 - ‘He shall then go out from you, he and his sons with him, and shall return to his family, that he may return to the possession of the land of his fathers.

42 - ‘For they are My slaves whom I brought out from the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold in a slave sale./

NOTE: A LOT of discussion, such as in Glenn Miller's work on this, is about whether the Jubilee freeing applies to foreigners. Based on findings supported above here, this is most likely a moot point.

It's not saying that the Jubilee is the sole hope for freedom from modernlike slavery, but that modernlike slavery is wrong for all, and all can leave their employers at will (not counting criminals) anyways, but Jubilee is a RITUAL tradition, a loyalty sign for signing onto the Mosaic covenant, that signing Hebrews did by convention where they would leave ANYWAYS even if they liked their bosses.

If a foreigner wanted to leave ANYWAYS (or a Hebrew) at any time, they already could, though. If anything this would be an imposition on the ebed or amah (female version of ebed in many passages, I think generally meant to be implied in those that as shorthand just say ebed, but perhaps not all per se, especially not where exceptions are spelled out) if they still were struggling financially and wanted to remain in the ebed relationship.

So most likely, no, Jubilee is a way they indicate they're in the covenant, and wouldn't apply to foreigners, but I did find that a lot of the time-based traditions did also include foreigners (presumably not in the covenant), so it's kind of unclear. Either way, it doesn't seem to be relevant to any kind of moral issue.

/43 - ‘You shall not have dominion over him with brutality, but you shall fear your God./

Here of course the rabid skeptic will eisegetically assume that you SHALL be brutal to the non-Hebrew! But the verses we just saw twice implied the opposite.

/44 - ‘As for your male and female slaves whom you may have—you may acquire male and female slaves from the nations that are around you./

Notice the Hebrew can sell HIMSELF (or presumably herself), but is still treated as if he isn't a slave (in other words, it's work for room and board plus an initial payment rather than work simply for an ongoing paycheck), while the foreigners cannot be sold BY Hebrews (this is banned in Exodus 21:16 though that's disputed. I could show that below but let's get through this Lev section first) but can be bought from outsiders (who the law for Israel can hardly have jurisdiction over in their eyes). And we'll see below this can include themselves:

/45 - ‘And also you may acquire from the sons of the foreign residents who sojourn among you, from them and their families who are with you; as for those whom they have begotten in your land, they also may become your possession.

46 - ‘You may even give them as an inheritance to your sons after you, to receive as a possession; you can use them as permanent slaves. But in respect to your brothers, the sons of Israel, you shall not have dominion over one another with brutality./

Notice it doesn't say anything like, about the non-Hebrew slaves "totes fine to be cruel to them tho!"

The skeptic assumes it's implied, but this is the skeptic's own head, not Scripture! They love to conflate things in their own mind with reality without evidence. They can hope they would FIND evidence if they look, but until I see it, I can't go with them on that assumption.

It LOOKS like it's saying it was ALREADY unthinkable basically for them to mistreat foreigners, whether ebeds/amahs (if you'll pardon English plural on Hebrew transliteration) or not, but they WERE often mistreating each other.

This would support a reason why Moses would wait until his sendoff speech to ban 'slavery' most clearly.

Notice we have TWO positive statements that push toward this (we have evidence, this is NOT an argument from silence!), and against this skeptics generally only offer arguments from silence, that it doesn't also say "oh and don't mistreat foreigners, but ironically the Sinai to MoDeath is NOT silent on that, at least in GENERAL (pardon all this allcaps emphasis for my Notepad copy of this but it's important to notice!). I won't try to here show them but they're all over it.

Many say explicitly that just like they didn't like what Egypt did to them, they should be kind to foreigners -- which seems to imply they shouldn't enslave foreigners or at least shouldn't mistreat them when in a role like that in any way.

/47 - ‘Now if the [fn]means of a sojourner or of a foreign resident with you becomes sufficient, and a brother of yours becomes so poor with regard to him as to sell himself to a sojourner who resides with you or to the descendants of a sojourner’s family,

48 - then he shall have redemption right after he has been sold. One of his brothers may redeem him,/ Then some verses about calculating for jubilee stuff for these Hebrew slaves of non-Hebrews, then continuing:

/Lev 25:53 - ‘Like a man hired year by year he shall be with him; he shall not have dominion over him with brutality in your sight.

54 - ‘Even if he is not redeemed by [fn]these means, he shall still go out in the year of jubilee, he and his sons with him.

55 - ‘For the sons of Israel are My slaves; they are My slaves whom I brought out from the land of Egypt. I am Yahweh your God./


In light of all that, claims like this from the skeptic here are patently ABSURD: "without the slightest hint of divine displeasure[.]" Come on!


3: "why is the almight, all-knowing deity required to accommodate his commands to the preferences of this little group of people?" Because he can't do wrong and it's wrong to violate freewill and if he demands too much, the hardhearted Jesus talked about at the time of Moses would have rejected signing onto the covenant more likely and then God has let the situation be even WORSE. Not rocket science here, but don't expect a brain to function in a skeptic.

(quote)He fearlessly bellows the mighty “THOU SHALT NOT”(end quote) LOL

(quote)things that did no harm to anyone (worshiping idols, religious freedom(end) WOW. Just wow. Worshipping pagan gods that like human sacrifice never hurt a fly! (Get it? Jephthah... Anywho).

By relfree he probably is trying to imply accusing it of being against but since he didn't say it clearly, he might actually be sneaking in a hint that he'd like to rob us of it and hates where it guaranteed it and implying he wouldn't be hurting us by taking it away. (It did allow relfree. Didn't condone and strongly condemned going back on your word after you promised to serve God though by signing onto the covenant; that's not anti relfree.)

4: Skeptic is the one playing around with words slave vs servant and dodging. It's a fact ebed and amah had a wide range of meaning whether skepticbrain finds that inconvenient for him or not.

"People could be kidnapped and sold," Not by people under the law! That got the death penalty! Okay, let's show it now.

/Exo 21:16 - “He who [fn]kidnaps a man, whether he sells him or he is found in his hand, shall surely be put to death./

Some claim this only refers to kidnapping someone else's slave, etc. but the same guys will try to argue based on decontextualist seeming face value in other places (he just did with the whole "dodge = ebed might mean servant in some uses" crap. They should admit this APPEARS not just to BAN what he just claimed, but to treat it in the most serious way it's POSSIBLE for the law to treat it!

This would at least SUGGEST that kidnapping of people NOT slaves would be all the worse! Or if somehow not as bad, at least illegal! (Remember it's didactic law. These are examples teaching principles, not merely saying the rules would apply only in these examples per se.)

However, the skeptic is using a debate cheat I call True Statement fallacy or error here. He (if it's a he) likely is using weasel wording on purpose by not saying WHO "could" kidnap (as in, a foreigner outside of Israel "could" do this, and if the law actually said Israel should invade those other countries to put such enslavers to death, the skeptic would be the first to whine about it for sure!) -- using the weasel wording to get a technically true statement because he was shamefully, almost certainly intentionally deceptively vague about who.

I wrote this about this error just yesterday for an unrelated reason:

(quoting me)For lack of a better term, I've called this the "True Statement Fallacy" or "Error" since I try to use "error" for fallacious reasoning I give a label of convenience but that isn't a label you'll find from others but it's a fallacy really.

Basically, try to find some way that you can get a true statement that is true both of the actual situation and of a situation you want to argue for instead of the actual situation, and then ignore all the evidence for the actual situation, and just build your case by whatever stretch you can for your proposed alternative, and act like the fact that you got a true statement we were forced to agree with means we should accept however much of a stretch you have to bridge.

(Which is a form of Politician's fallacy; we must do something (in this case, the truth must be something), this is something, let's do this (or you must conclude this). Or more specifically in this case, "The truth is something that fits this true statement. This is a thing that fits that true statement, so the truth is this.")

... This is a common debate cheat; getting a true statement by making something sound so vague it can hardly fail to accurately describe the specific situation we know, and then acting like that means he could ignore all of what shows why we know how to describe it more specifically in one way, to then act like he has justified some other specific "how".

To be fair, that debate cheat can happen by accident a lot, and I'm not arguing guilt by association.(end quoting me)

"taken in war and sold" So evidently this one DOES object to that! Of course some of these loons actually think Israel is commanded to go around raiding neighboring cities for no self-defense reason to collect slaves (seriously). But if another nation does attack them, the alternative is to kill them all. A 'careful what you wish for' situation.

"forced into debt and then sold" LOL, yes that's another "true statement" that someone could be forced into debt (passive voice... forced by humans? That could even happen too!) and then (a lot in that "and then" he's skipping over curiously!) sold (by themselves ONLY if within Israel! He ignores that part, and sold into WHAT? Not anything like objectionable SLAVERY -- only like servanthood! True statements abound here!

"Stop dodging." And there's the punchline of the true statement debate cheat, and the red flag that it is that, not an honest truthseeker who wants to be careful not to assume things uncharitably.

5. We aren't ignoring passages he cited. We're showing why they didn't immediately ban it and had an even higher priority, everybody's death due to sin, solving this FIRST as widely as possible, THEN addressing other crucial issues more subtly, rather than just causing instant biased rejection by those hardened into assumptions that slavery is okay BEFORE they have experienced that heart reform.

Skeptic's priorities are backwards and ironically counterproductive for his own (claimed) goal of wanting slavery to stop. Christianity by this means ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISHED THAT GOAL (pardon cap emph).

Important here too to understand that Jesus in Matthew 19 was telling Christians WHICH aspects of the Mosaic law do still apply in the Christian covenant; in essense, the ones that teach God's desires based on the original pattern.

This at least strongly suggests Christian-led abolition was in accord with God's desires and implications biblically (I dunno if we have actual statements that they consciously noticed this, but either way it backs up what they did); the Deuteronomy statement, that slavery (modernlike def) is "wronging" the one under authority, would still apply and is context the NT didn't need to exlicitly repeat, since the NT DOES lay the groundwork to notice it applies.

Since he repeats enlightenment, let's look at it a bit more.

Again, there probably was influence from that (but that would hardly have been pro equality -- that idea comes from the Bible, the world was typically AGAINST this; this is probably the modern skeptic trying to retcon which side anti-Bible arguers at the time were largely on), and I'm not claiming I've read everything on what they said were their influence, though noting again that others who say they do have sufficient understanding of it wildly disagree with his characterization here.

So I won't be assuming the skeptic hasn't actually found a credible source that claims based on real expertise, and/or thorough reading and logical handling, that they largely decried the Bible and so on and saw that as they side that would be pro equality as opposed to the other way around (though the other way around looks correct right now as far as I know, and that more likely this skeptic is botching this history as much as he's demonstrably botching what I CAN more readily test, his handling of the Bible).

All those cautions aside, PROBABLY I would expect the skeptic is just lazily guessing a false cause fallacy here -- X happens, then Y happens, therefore X caused Y; enlightenment happened, then abolition, so enlight caused abol.

But this works just as much for us!

Luther's work, and others, to get the Bible more into the hands of the everyday people increases the likelihood that they more often notice all of these admonitions and other details that push STRONGLY against modern-def slavery, while allowing things called "slavery" in some translations (possibly motivated by PRO modern-def slavery translators! And/or by people who just used the word "slavery" in English in wider senses including servanthood) that on close examination don't seem objectionable at all and in fact provide social safety nets for debt life emergencies, and handling of violent criminals in a safer way, etc.

So we could just as easily argue Luther then abolition, so Luther caused abolition. And Luther (and others) were providing access to the Bible... so this is akin to Bible access happened, then abolition happened, therefore Bible access caused abolition!

In fact, we can actually SUPPORT that from all these passages that DO push against slavery and from the well-known fact that abolitionists are said (by those who do say they study this) to have based their arguments mainly on the Bible, while opponents were a mix, more often appealing to general secular concepts, sometimes twisting the Bible, but demonstrably so.

Our skeptic says: "And it only took 1,700 years" And a google result says for timing of Martin Luther: "10 November 1483– 18 February 1546"

Our skeptic says: "at the same time as the Enlightenment. Hmmmm." So this is an explicit admission that he isn't basing this on study but purely the lazy false cause fallacy!

When was the Enlightenment? A google result: "European politics, philosophy, science and communications were radically reoriented during the course of the “long 18th century” (1685-1815)" False cause fallacy might "suggest" Luther and the Bible caused the "Enlightenment" if it caused abolition due simply to happening after its start!

US abolition: 1865. Britain 1833.

Quick google result for some initial context: (quote)What are the factors that led to the abolition of slavery?
According to historians, the relatively rapid abolition of the trans-Atlantic slave trade is explained by ideological, religious, and economic change in Europe and the Americas. There is much debate about which factor was most important.(end quote)

Again, we would need much more study to support that, but all of this is based on a basic is/ought fallacy anyways, that if it is that people who were anti-Bible contributed to abolitionism, that being anti-Bible "ought" to inherently be against abolitionism and or that in reverse, someone obeying the Bible "ought" to be pro-slavery on those grounds.

It is indeed much more likely that Christianity created the climate in the West toward equality, within which an anti-Bible movement was forced to operate, and that of course ALL factors at the time led to abolition. All of this is obviously consistent with am omniscient Creator using a long chess strategy to defeat the reign of sin despite the rule against violating freewill.

God can influence history through Christ to trap even anti-biblicists into being used by Him to advance His cause.

(So, this "by pure coincidence" thing is pure strawman.)

Point 6 is entirely refuted above already. 7. Interestingly, the skeptic in point 7 appears to CONCEDE that abolition "has a huge debt to Christian influence"! Then just repeats the same errors like potency error in reply to blindly assume what God's "job" is (I guess this skeptic is God's boss!). And falsely claiming "condoning" "it" (ebed? Or modern-sense slaverY? He BANNED the latter!)

Then "merrily" allowed it. This goes to the common error debunked by Romans 9 that if evil happens God WANTS it.

I've shown before in the debunking of the Problem of Evil bad argument that instead, God in his omniscience knows alternative ways to handle evil would actually be WORSE if we bother to think if through as skeptics refuse.

This isn't about merely something like balance of good or the like, but that to choose the worse "history designs" (original setup knowing all it would lead to by domino effect plus setup of when/where/how he intervenes and all butterfly effect from that) would be a sin and God can't sin and can't do the logically impossible so he had no choice, in a way that doesn't make him weak, doesn't contradict any of his omni traits, etc.

So objections to "soul-making" or "greater good" theodicies are irrelevant here. Those can also play a role in this, and that there is no greater good is related here, but the point is it shows that God is morally obligated to take the least evil route, and that more importantly it's proven that no non-evil route can exist.

Long story short. I do this by testing all of the most basic possible history designs and show that ALL the most basic alternatives including the one skeptics normally advise when making the PoE bad argument are WORSE.

To be clear I don't need to, so don't try to, show that all SPECIFICS of the history design are ideal, but it does move us toward that, and many other tests of every known accusation to the contrary have shown they're debunked where testable.

We would need to be omniscient to test that FULLY, and skeptics will then whine "oh so mysteryyyyy!" but are actually the ones arguing from ignorance there in just blindly assuming God could know some better design on whatever specific they pick like fawn fire death, kid cancer, etc. so the objection is self-refuting.

So God DID need to allow us to have freewill, I showed also that this would always EVENTUALLY lead to sin, that constantly stopping OUTWARD sins would only MORE likely cause internal sins (hating that God is stopping the consequences of our sins if left to natural results, never really experiencing how bad those results would be), all other suggestions just mix and match the WORSE world designs.

Thus, God did need to allow us to sin and let natural consequences normally happen, not miraculously protect us, once we did sin, from things like hurricanes or fires or genetic decay (lest he send the wrong message of seeming to condone our sins). He had a MORAL obligation to do this, not an inability to stop it. He knew stopping INTERNAL evils by direct override is WRONG (just mind-control, also really shallow -- without our ASKING him to do this which Christians DO after he got through to us through heart-reform and Christ's atonement), and that stopping outward ones would just cause more internal.

Thus, it was logically necessary that God allow evils in general -- even if it takes a LONG time to advance the chess strategy against it (not a game) to expand the Rock that grows to fill the world (re Daniel; Christianity in the Rock of Christ), and he "endures" per Romans 9 this evil. He also has the RIGHT to do all of this, like the potter with clay.

See especially Romans 9:14 (LSB is a good clear one on this), which affirms this isn't arbitrary (isn't unrighteousness), and 22 which confirms he "endured" evil, and those he foreknew would never repent of it to their ends in this life so go to hell (as other biblical context clarifies). Some argue based "desires" in verse 18 otherwise, but it can't overrule context in the same chapter and should be read in light of it.

Obviously it isn't saying God would irresponsibly do whatever he wanted even though he knows it would lead to unintended consequences. It obviously means he DOES know how to act wisely and when it will have the least of those, all things considered (for the WHOLE of history design).

So no, he didn't condone it (slavery), yes he said it's (slavery is) "wronging," and no, when he allowed "it" (NON-slavery, by any objectionable sense, just things ALSO about being under authority in OTHER ways) he didn't do so "merrily".

He didn't want debt "slavery" or even servanthood! He wanted us not to sin in the first place and have food easily accessed everywhere with easy fun gardening work and the like, no curse, no fall, no death, and obviously no need for slavery or servanthood.

I mean I guess people could have taken on other tasks on their own like a scientific study and others could have, if people hadn't sinned and humanity expanded beyond two etc., volunteered to help, so serving in a sense. But this wouldn't be much at all like what I'm talking about that was allowed in Law of Moses.

8. The skeptic's claim here is evidently unsupported that Christianity owes its debt to the Enlightenment for abolition. No attempt at support is offered here at least, so no further reply would be needed until he or someone does. That said, see what I said earlier about God using all of this, so any positive influence would be THROUGH the Enlightenment by God! So this would hardly work as an anti-Bible point. Just a very confused skeptic.















Comment 2: I like the term excusegetics. Describes what the skeptic is doing well!

1. Strawmans God as human.

Against the rest, just acts as if his bald assertions of "lame" and "no" (legitimate) "excuse" are.. arguments. They're just folly on the skeptic's part as far as he has supported so far. They often act like their assurances should be taken seriously. They really shouldn't. Wherever testable they pretty much fail miserably.

We can't (on crywolf principle) blindly assume each is false... but the onus is very much, very heavily on the skeptic, and the whole careless, biased attitude it is telling.

2. Falsely assumes God's "followers" (as if they're actually in this being obedient when it's proven this is DISobedience) were slavers.

Probably some implied true statement fallacy there too; it's POSSIBLE some of them are allowed into heaven, really thought it was okay at the time somehow, didn't know enough about the Bible to see where it condemns it etc., so he could say that they were saved, so "followers" in that sense (which we don't even know) to sneak in an insinuation that God must have approved of the slavery they committed. Doesn't work that way.

Racial divides can be excused by antibiblicists, especially atheists with no objective moral grounding against it. Bible provides the OBJECTIVE ground to condemn it!

And has a track record of healing historically-seemingly unhealable wounds.

3. "Christians did not even consider taking it that way for 1,700 years." Whoa there, that's a massive black swan fallacy.

And acting like they generally even had the power to change it politically. That's not so easy! The point where highly BIBLICAL Christians actually finally largely GAINED power -- in the US -- went RAPIDLY to abolition!

Still-heavily-pagan-influenced Europe was MUCH more resistant -- the very groups US Christians fled.

"The Enlightenment - god had precisely nothing to do with it" Quite a bait and switch. It went from the Enlightenment might have had SOME role since abolition happened afterward to somehow now God (capital G he means but we know how these types are) had "nothing" to do with it.

(Also probably a bit of "on atheism, it's a true statement" fallacy (circular reasoning variant; obviously we DO think God EXISTS -- if he wanted to avoid weasel circles, he should have said the BIBLE had supposedly nothing to do with it!)

"and it would never have occurred to christianity without that (remember, 1,700 YEARs of christianity, 1,400 years of it being the dominant force in the western world, without that idea showing up even once)." More explicit confirmation his attempted support for that it, as far as he is actually providing, ONLY the false cause fallacy.

With yet another black swan fallacy thrown in at the end for good measure. I see implications of it in Philemon and Deuteronomy, possibly others among the NT cases too (offhand I forget which and trying to get through this after now a few hours of work on it so let's just move on for now; I've posted about it to past convos on comment sections of this channel in the past).

"Mr. Ortlund, like most excusegeticists, is sitting in the present day and reverse-engineering his bible" Ironically that's what the skeptic is doing, projecting modern definitions of "slavery" onto passages not about it, etc.

4. Sure the old "humans do what's right" excuse, accidentally undermining all of that "it took so loooooong!" crap. Humans on their own didn't undo slavery -- only with God's heart-based reform through the successful biblical strategy did that finally get actually accomplished.

He "knows" slavery is wrong because he grew up in a Christianized society that got this from God. Irony.

"it stands to reason that what harms me as a human would be harmful to others as a human, so I should not do it." "Should". And yet so many other humans think they "should" look out for number one, compete to be the fittest, etc.

"This is how the Enlightenment thinkers came up with the idea that slavery is wrong...an idea that had NEVER occurred to any christian thinker in 1,700 years." It's the golden rule, popularized in Christianized societies more than it had before. Treat others how you want to be treated. Pure coincidence!

5. "The fact that christians today claim to believe that slavery is wrong (but it wasn't in the good old days, right?)" Important misconception (or intentional distortion but whatever) -- EBED in general, doing work for someone else, possibly with room and board as the pay (with or without an allowance, though one often was given) instead of a salary, is what was allowed in the "good old days".

SLAVERY (as defined, see Glenn Miller for the full rigorous definition) wasn't GOOD in the old days, and it was the Bible that made that clear and worked against it.

Skeptics like to use cheats like this (or possibly innocent misunderstandings but given this guy's irresponsible attitude, I'm thinking an intentional cheat, or a self-causing closed mind trap at best) basically blurring their eyes and pretending that pointing out different ancient circumstances is saying bad stuff was okay in the past.

"is because a movement outside their religion took root in the surrounding society, and christianity was then forced - kicking and screaming - to go along with it in order to survive." Other way around. Ironic he doesn't know this. (Supposedly. He probably got the idea from us so does know better, and all this shoddy false cause stuff is his attempt to justify an intentionally backwards approach.)

"freedom of religion (grudgingly, it's anti-biblical after all)" There he weighs in on what he meant by that. Obviously this is false. Acts especially demonstrates this. I'm sure it's pure coincidence the most biblical Christians led the charge on it and somehow purely the Enlightenment's doing with that in turn of course having absolutely zero influence from... "god" LOL.




Comment 3 (of RB101, still just in your comment 1). "Saying that Christianity is a force against slavery seems to me like a gross distortion of the truth." This is a significant reversal giving ground back to Christianity. Now instead of zero cause at all, it's merely a distortion.

"A claim that US slavery was abolished due to Christians completely discounts that there were Christians on both sides" Excuses excuses. It doesn't; this is talked about by those of us who say that. And debunked as relevant. Of course both sides will claim it supports them; that tells you nothing about which side it does support, and changes nothing about the fact that slavery was A-okay to all those humans all that time until CHRISTIANITY led the reform.

"the side against slavery didn't primarily use the bible to defend their position" Needs proven, and oh so they DID use it. Ground given back to us once again. And how is it measured? We need only that it was the foundational cause, and the most demonstrated.

Amount of arguments wouldn't be relevant as they would be motivated to engage the wider society on its own grounds to show that even by its own standards it should agree with them, where the secular aspects of the Enlightenment had influenced those less biblical.

"The first known ban against slavery was from the Persian king Kyros II in 500 BC" I haven't studied that. It's certainly true that the vast majority of other societies allowed it. Also Moses was MUCH earlier than 500 BC!

"so calling it a Christian idea just isn't correct." That doesn't follow, since the argument isn't about 500-BC Persia at all but that it provided the idea in once-pagan Europe.

And if we wanted to look there to Persia, how do I know it wasn't incluenced by God in various ways? But we're NOT saying it was ALWAYS allowed by all against God, which would be black swan fallacy anyways, but that we KNOW positively it was present in a LOT of places that were against God and on the whole global society never experience such a widespread reform (to what I think would be the Genesis pattern against slavery).

Besides, for such a late thing, if in fact, that really was a ban on slavery which I can't assume because an unreliable skeptic says it, how could we ever rule out any direct influence from Moses? That wouldn't be "Christian" (true statement error risk again), but loyal to the same God, happening before the other, and we were told before should lead us to think caused. (It shouldn't lead us to assume that, but it does open the door for it possibly!)


"There are different ways to read the Bible." There are different ways to read the skeptic's claim too. I think it means pancakes are free in every restaurant that sells pancakes.

"I think it's completely valid to excoriate anyone who reads the Bible as the literal word of God for it's position on slavery." Its. Not it's. Anywho.

It's wrong to conflate affirming literal-ness (in the modern sense of literal; non-figurative) of passages the SOURCE language rules (and "language culture" when Hebrews are writing in other languages like NT GreeK) say are literal with reading passages the rules say are figurative as literal, and then set up a false dichotomy that if they reject the latter, they must reject the former, etc. and act like the skeptic is on moral high ground when really he's on the ground of a completely irresponsible moron.

It's also obviously an emotional audience-swaying cheat intended to put the RESPONSIBLE truth-seeker on the defensive, rather than daring to be a responsible SKEPTIC (in the real sense of the word) who can have a good attitude and will be careful not to claim passages mean things that go AGAINST what the rules of the source language culture say they mean objectively.

But I like it. Because "careful what you wish for, moron".

Trolling though. And likely with the readied, if we walk on eggshells around this skeptic, hand-wringing, trying to appeal to his conscience to be better, he obviously doesn't care, and wants that, to make us look weak, when that wouldn't be the concern of those doing that at all but to avoid driving him away from possibly seeing his mistakes.

And with readied, if we don't, if we'll boldly and responsibly debunk and show how absolutely stupid, absurd, dangerous, and offensive his approach and treat him the way he treats others, then he would have the victim card ready, and the "Jesus people should be niiiiice!"

(MOST likely from my experience; this is what this approach that he is parroting -- that's not his idea, it's almost word for word from populist skeptics -- seems designed to do, and USUALLY is how it's used. Basically a dressed up circular reasoning approach used to justify scorn. We instead use scorn where needed AFTER proving what we do affirm and where someone had legitimate chances to know better than their mistakes.)

As such, although it's POSSIBLE some gullible skeptics fall for this populist strategy innocently, so I can't use guilt by association fallacy and assume it's the case for this one, it's still a red flag, a sign of someone who doesn't really care about people, isn't some moral hero, this is just an excuse.

Of course, they're trained with ready (bad) responses to that too. Which is probably part of the point too -- anything to add things that if we DO respond to them, they can pounce on any way they know of to distract from what a REASONABLE questioner WOULD have done, a constructive, SIMPLE, cooperative discussion about the evidence and logic.

Let's be honest -- this is directly his attempt to excuse why he won't just do that. The obvious most likely motive is fear of where a FAIR discussion would lead.

As such this is a red flag of someone who MOST likely knows he doesn't have proper grounding for his attacks.

"Clearly it's still a problem if the creator of the universe doesn't understand morality in a way that modern humans find palatable" Sneaking in some is/ought fallacy for good measure, likely readying the intentional trap that if we call him on this one, he'll say something like "Oh so you're pro-slavery!"












RB101 Comment 6, quoted in your 3: "The bible uses the cute euphemism "concubines," but it not only encourages having them, it provides instructions on how to get some for yourself" Unsure what he's vaguely alluding to here.

Given that he continues after to talk about slaves, my first guess of what he might have had in mind but didn't say for what concubines would be euphemism for is sex slaves.

This might be the whole (well-known to be debunked; basically skeptics just circularly eisegete it in) Numbers 31 nonsense, or the Deut knife passage (the knife is the key problem, and the rest is ignoring how ancient societies worked and of course again anachronistically eisegeting in a replacement).

As for concubines, in the case of Solomon I think it's pretty strongly implied it's wrong!

If he meant some other secret-decoder-ring "theory" of what it means, I don't know what it would be offhand. Maybe would have been clear in context of what he was replying to. Otherwise onus would be on him to just say it.

"2) Christians happily held slaves" Some more true statement fallacy/error. Rest of that comment just repeats errors covered already above.




RB7: Covered above in Lev 25 (you see that here he's doing what I said they usually do, and just blindly assuming it means they can't go free until Jubilee and that foreigners can't, despite the evidence they explicitly can go free at will!) and surrounding considerations about "enslave" fellow Israelite...

Except that actually, no, an Israelite can't enslave a fellow Israelite evidently, the fellow Israelite can "sell" himself as an EBED in general and ISN'T to be treated as a slave, but that's not his main point here -- but worth calling him on that error too. They love to sneak in any error they can!

And desperately hope we'll let some of them slide no doubt and act like that's victory probably. Likewise they don't enslave foreigners. Those ALREADY enslaved OUTSIDE Israel by foreigners can be bought to free.

Interesting that he went from true statement fallacy earlier about buying slaves, to now sneaking in a new premise that these are even enslaved by Israelites. Exactly the pattern of how true statement error is usually used in my experience. Sus.

LOL, "like any other livestock" ! Wow.

And some "slavery is slavery" scamming thrown in. Nice. Classic red flag. Is ebed always slavery? Hm? Is ebed always the definition of slavery that Glenn Miller defined?

Let's put that here to be direct. I see (and had forgotten offhand) he uses chattel slavery for it.

(quoting Glenn Miller, with added paragraph breaks)1.     Introductory remarks

I am a child of the Western World, and a native of the rural American South. The word 'slavery' is such a powerful vortex of images, meanings, cries, and grief to me. Any technical discussion of any type of forced labor or corvee becomes immediately inflamed when the word 'slavery' is attached to it, and I suspect that many others share this association.

Scholars in the ANE have often abandoned the use of the general term 'slavery' in descriptions of the many diverse forms of master-servant that are manifest in the ancient world. There are very few 'true' slave societies in the world (with Rome and Greek being two of the major ones!), and ancient Israel will be seen to be outside this classification as well (in legislation, not practice).

A recent example of this comes from the discussion of the Hittite culture in [HI:HANEL:1.632]:

"Guterbock refers to 'slaves in the strict sense,' apparently referring to chattel slaves such as those of classical antiquity. This characterization may have been valid for house slaves whose master could treat them as he wished when they were at fault, but it is less suitable when they were capable of owning property and could pay betrothal money or fines.

The meaning 'servant' seems more appropriate, or perhaps the designation 'semi-free'. It comprises every person who is subject to orders or dependent on another but nonetheless has a certain independence within his own sphere of active."

Scholars in Cultural Anthropology are sensitive to this as well, and point out that New World slavery was quite unique, historically:

"Scholars do not agree on a definition of "slavery." The term has been used at various times for a wide range of institutions, including plantation slavery, forced labor, the drudgery of factories and sweatshops, child labor, semivoluntary prostitution, bride-price marriage, child adoption for payment, and paid-for surrogate motherhood.

Somewhere within this range, the literal meaning of "slavery" shifts into metaphorical meaning, but it is not entirely clear at what point. A similar problem arises when we look at other cultures.

The reason is that the term "Slavery" is evocative rather than analytical, calling to mind a loose bundle of diagnostic features.

These features are mainly derived from the most recent direct Western experience with slavery, that of the southern United States, the Caribbean, and Latin America.

The present Western image of slavery has been haphazardly constructed out of the representations of that experience in nineteenth-century abolitionist literature, and later novels, textbooks, and films...From a global cross-cultural and historical perspective, however, New World slavery was a unique conjunction of features...

In brief, most varieties of slavery did not exhibit the three elements that were dominant in the New World: slaves as property and commodities; their use exclusively as labor; and their lack of freedom..." [NS:ECA:4:1190f]

Generally, in the ANE, these 'fuzzy' boundaries obtain as well. "Slavery" is a very relative word in our time period, and we have to be very carefully in no auto-associating it with more 'vivid' New World examples.

For example, in the West we would never say that the American President's Cabinet members were his 'slaves', but this term would have been applied to them in the ANE kingdoms.

And, in the ANE, even though children/family could be bought and sold, they were never actually referred to as 'slaves'--the property aspect (for such transactions) did NOT define explicitly the notion of 'slavery':(pause quote)

He goes on with more; I won't be quoting the whole article obviously, but this is important foundational context. Against this I have seen one skeptic whine that "slavery is slavery" let's him insist his criticism isn't about the modern idea at all -- which is rather naive to assume he hasn't been influenced by it psychologically in any way -- but even if we granted that, it's demonstrable fact that:

1) Words CAN have ranges of meanings, and it's extremely irresponsible to act like this stops when one of the ranges is extremely emotionally charged.

ESPECIALLY when that emotional charge happened largely AFTER the word was used in other senses and then to use that to claim the older writings MUST have meant ONLY the objectionable one. This is true EVEN IF those who used it DID think the objectionable one was okay and even if they wrongly thought the objectionable one we'll define in a moment was the one the Bible meant (even more likely if they were pro-slavery in that negative sense).

2) MUCH of the reason we have to say things like "not slavery in the sense of" is ONLY because ENGLISH TRANSLATORS have often chosen (rightly or wrongly, for whatever reason, the fact is the word is IN the translation) to translate ebed as slave, and it's WRONG for the skeptic to blindly assume this is a GOOD translation EVEN IF the word "slave" in ENGLISH should always go with something deeply bad like what Miller will define and use "chattel slavery" as his term for, for his clarity purposes.

This has NO weight at all in proving the HEBREW authors intended anything that moderns would on full and fair analysis show is bad legitimately.

They might insist that work should always be for pay and if the payer can't afford it God should magically make money or whatever -- in my review of Josh Bowen's shamefully stupid attempt to get out of the conclusive debunkings offered by Jon McCray of the whaddo You Meme channel of bad arguments for Bible as pro-slavery by Cosmic Skeptic (Alex O'Connor), in that review I was shocked to see the crazy argument really used by Josh Bowen (of Digital Hammurabi) that regardless of whether they obeyed God, Israel was promised, essentially, wealth.

He even explicitly said he thought would be provided miraculously (as opposed to God just pointing out that following his wise laws would generally avoid the problems that lead to poverty in the first place, so more providential), though he didn't seem to think coins themselves would, but his argument was basically that insane.

I know it sounds like it would have to be a strawman to even bring up the idea that skeptics might mean that, and hopefully most aren't that dumb, but that one literally did.

Think about this. This means that the skeptic is allying with the often PRO-slavery people who would want chattel slavery and would celebrate translations that used "slavery" of things allowed, so they could act like the mere use of the word justifies their sinful endorsement of things OTHER passages BAN.

The skeptic revels in being able to find SHORT snippy smart-alecky comments that can make it sound like if we don't respond with as short a comment that emotionally seems to trap him the same way he tries to trap us, then we must have the moral low ground.

Again let's be honest -- that's exactly what's happening here with this skeptic.

3) If "slavery is slavery" then we ABSOLUTELY CAN simply say that the English translations are wrong!

Because I don't think snippy scam traps are respectable, though I recognize how they may effectively scam people, I don't have a problem, for important reasons grounded in the rules of how logic works (which this scam ignores) if people want to use "slave" in senses OTHER than objectively wrong things

If we WANTED to be just as short and persuasive to those without the patience to read a full, proper analysis, though, the skeptic is opening himself up to MASSIVE weakness in many ways here.

For example, "slavery is slavery" -- thus on HIS OWN PREMISE we can point to "SLAVE" in Deuteronomy 23:15-16 being said to be "wronged" if they aren't allowed to free themselves at will, which bans "SLAVERY" ever being enforced as okay by ALL the objectionable definitions!

When we point out Deut. 23:15-16, the skeptics trip all over themselves running this way and that way desperate to defang it.

"IT DOESN'T MEAN 'SLAVE' IN GENERAL!" they scream, foaming at the mouth. "ITSH JUST FOREIGN SLAVES.... Wait... ummmmmmm.... ITSH JUST FOREIGN SLAVES who escaped FOREIGN slave masters... f-from OUTSIDE Israel!"

Oh but it doesn't say that. "Slavery is slavery!" we can point out.

Of course, then they'll go for "ITSH A CONTRADICTION!" LOL. Or they would if they were smart. Usually they're eager to do so; it's telling that here they try to avoid it (in my experience).

4) "Slavery is slavery" shirks the duty to objectively prove that something is wrong handling words carefully according to the rules of logic. This kind of shoddy thinking, especially on moral issues, is dangerous and can backfire and lead ironically to allowing legitimately bad things with similar word games. ("Slavery is slavery" used seriously, rather than as a reductio ad absurdum as I did above, is shameful word games, period. I'll show why next.)

Objectively, we COULD define words any way we want in logic. We generally SHOULDN'T, but the principles for why are strongly against this skeptic's approach here in "slavery is slavery" (which is a blatant equivocation fallacy).

If not for the principles for why we generally shouldn't, someone CAN assign any definition to any jumble of words, as long as it's defined somewhere.

When we're pointing to the context, this isn't excuses. It's showing the ACTUAL definition of words like ebed, and the senses that were actually intended in each specific usage, so far as we can determine (not saying all will have enough context to crystal clearly narrow that down 100% though, to be fair).

The principles for why we generally shouldn't are ONLY about what senses of the words exist in the target language!

So when we have a wide swath of society that is the first to say that slavery as chattel type is wrong can also call themselves "slave to Christ" and don't see it as meaning anything that can be objectively shown to be wrong, it's careless to just blindly assume they should never say that.

An argument they shouldn't can be fairly considered on the same principle as well-known senses are reduced over time as less-known ones fade from public awareness, but it's never responsible to then retcon this back over history.

That's what the skeptic is doing here. Even if English originally had ONLY negative connotations of "slavery", even if (which is difficult to test) all translators who picked that word for things in the Bible ever allowed were pro-"slavery" in these negative sense we're about to define per Glenn Miller, or even others we could objectively show to be morally wrong, those of us who prove the Bible itself did NOT endorse anything bad can still say things like "slave, in this passage, in the sense of what the Hebrew sense of this word in view here by the author as proven by such and such a consideration like Deut 23" rather than saying "it says slave here but it should be servant" in every case.

So English would have TAKEN ON multiple meanings including one that's good at least, IF the Bible was against anything bad and EVEN IF English ORIGINALLY had solely negative uses of "slavery!"

Read that last paragraph again. THIS is where the skeptic's "slavery is slavery" whine is shown to be extremely irresponsible, and would unwittingly miss that if the Bible is true and only condones GOOD things, and handles rightly how to lead to the lessening and eventual defeat of all bad things, then the situation WOULD be produced where English "slavery" would TAKE ON a "good" meaning!

So the skeptic has just dressed up circular reasoning.

They revel in when they can do this in a way that would require such a long answer to untangle and expose too!

They have ready "if it takes that long to reply I must be right", on the moral high horse.



Let's look at the whole sentence and the next to see yet another rather idiotic problem, likely also designed to set up the same "long reply bad" trap-defense against showing why it unravels.

"Slavery is slavery, and there is no such thing as good or kind slavery. An all-knowing being would know that." Since "slavery" is an English word not in the Bible that God inspired, not in anything God said, this actually (MAYBE accidentally? Doubt it) sneaks in another implication, or something we would need in order for it to "work" -- that God should have been mind-controlling everybody after to NEVER translate the word as slavery since it would have a negative meaning, at least one.

But if that's the objection, why bother whining about such an indirect objection as all of this in the first place? Might as well cut to the chase and apply this consistently to everything bad and just say "God should mind-control everybody so they never do ANYTHING bad".

If the skeptic will admit this is all silly and God's obligations here are only about the wording in the autographs -- the Bible, not, as some might say for example, "the KJV Bible" LOL or and approach of "pretend the translation is the Bible in the sense of inerrant, or that if the copies and translations are inerrant we have problems" (all of which is debunked) and probably then "THE BIBLE IS THE BIBLE!" LOL and such -- then there's little the skeptic can do, really.

They could whine that God should never have allowed a generic word for anyone under authority, perhaps.

(Most of them probably would have to be dragged kicking and screaming to admit that pointing it out is anything but a modern excuse though. But that is itself just an irresponsible critic's lame excuse.)

But that's... I mean, patently silly.

Even today we can have categorical ways in English to describe that, like what I said right there; "anyone under any sense of authority, whether right or wrong" to expand it a bit.

So now I can say "ANYONE UNDER AUTHORITY IS ANYONE UNDER AUTHORITY! Do you, Mr. Skeptic, condone any cases of anyone being under authority in any sense? HMMMM? If you do, you must be EEEEEEEVIL! AND if you whine that there are different senses, it's excusegesis and excusegetics!"

Of course, if we did that, without first clarifying we don't literally think that's a good argument (other than that it IS a valid reductio ad absurdum of this foolish skeptic's argument), they could attack us for that.

And if we instead build a proper case like this, they can just cherrypick parts of it. "GASP! LOGICIANBONES IS PRO-SLAVERY! HE SAID SOME SENSES OF SLAVERY ARE GOOD!"

And the skeptic can carefully refrain from every bothering to build a proper case, and use a cheat of shirking answering reductio ad absurdum challenge questions like "Tell me, is it ever okay for someone to be under authority of someone else in any sense? Slaves are under authority in a sense, so being under authority is being under authority! Don't play word games to get out of it! That's lame!"

We have hope if we can just keep holding their feet to the fire and force them to either ignore or answer and try to defend their horrible arguments though. Of course, this is why many want to just resort to being the authority on who is supposedly bad and "protect society" from us by not letting us speak freely, wherever they can, limit reach, guilt by association with others who really are bad, etc. Oh the games they play.




RB5, your 3rd; let's cover this before I continue in GM: "The Bible is emphatic about things god found immoral & completely against his nature.  Apparently, god was able to clearly stop those things....but when it came to slavery, he needed thousands of years to make it immoral.""

First, again the usual small-g god, which is a finite being in normal use in English. Notice that he is here rejecting the standard in logic that you SHOULD NOT use a sense that has a problematic meaning!

Here, it's that he's insinuating, as they're trained to, that God is just a finite being if anything, by circular reasoning, or indirectly manmade (that the pattern of what he's said to do is either way more fitting with a finite being -- note that I myself usually use lowercase for the pronouns as it's what I'm more used to, possibly for bad reasons too, but to be fair, in Hebrew there was no capitalization, and his "they give ground" fallacy were to be valid, he could use it here, but it isn't, and the actually important ground he listed is actually all from the Bible in the first place).

Problem is, when objectively tested, the implication backfires, and it's shown that at every turn, God's behavior pattern instead fits an omniscient perfect being and the skeptic's objection pattern that of a Dunning-Kruger moron and so on.

Anywho, that aside, he would need to actually go example by example through all these other cases and prove at least one that would somehow disprove our hardheartedness-concession argument -- which patently is guaranteed to be a good argument though... At least in principle that there could be things which would have been a "last straw" for the sinful to reject God's Word and be even worse to people.

(By the way, all kinds of "I also will ask you a question, Pharisee" 'traps' we could set for the skeptic here in Reductio Ad Absurdum (RAA) sense imitating the traps he and others like him try to ensnare us and the Bible in. Example "If God demanded too much perfection and people rejected even the regulation of 'slavery' and were even crueller to slaves, and never led to abolition, would you like that outcome?")

SOME of God's demands would be impositions, absolutely! The history of their almost continually committing idoloatry for example shows they didn't like that one. In fact, on that one many DID entirely reject him. As I've pointed out before, Israel was often right on the edge of rejection.

If in fact we're wrong about ebed, and the Mosaic law does have Matthew 19:8-style concessions toward chattel, we don't NEED the Bible to EVER comment on it.

Instead, we would be able to prove on objective moral grounds, BECAUSE we follow the Bible's command to "test everything" (some "core thesis" aspects going on here; my term for the idea that those who reject the Bible are almost always observed to be less logical ironically, among similar observations, in contrast to Christians who are much more often demonstrably reasonable), and from other biblical principles, we would be able to see that slavery (in any negative sense) is wrong.

Then we would wonder why it didn't say so, and in light of the hardheartedness principle, we would see that this would be because the Israelites at the time of Moses were so hard-hearted that if God had demanded they stop, that would have been the straw of God pushing toward perfection that would have broken the camel's back of getting Israel to accept OFTEN ENOUGH.

We would realize our CAREFUL and ACTUALLY EMPATHETIC (not "pathetic") concern for avoiding slavery as much as possible, and limiting how often slaves are abused physically, should make us agree that God was WISE to refrain from asking too much.

It would be CRAZY given the history of how constantly full of flagrant sin Israel was that God could add things on top of his existing demands and that this wouldn't be too much.

We would be horrified at what would result if the skeptic's advise had actually been followed.

The skeptic's advise would, on these premises, have led to MORE SLAVERY.

AND to doubling down on the abuses!

Skeptic advice HURTS PEOPLE if followed.

We would then realize this also applied to the NT era... and the skeptic's objections evaporate EVEN IF we didn't have statements like Deuteronomy 23:15-16!

We might also see the skeptic's raging carelessness as possibly psychopathic on this subject.

Playing games with ethics as a "gotcha" is very arguably heinous.


Of course, we CAN'T assume that Israel WANTED modern slavery or a similar sense of the term. If they DID NOT, then all the skeptic's arguments ALSO evaporate!

If they didn't, then it makes sense that Moses would say simply "people under authority can always go free, at will, you can't send them back, don't wrong them".

It makes sense he would wait to phrase it that clearly until the end of his life and the moments leading up to the culmination of the founding of the land-owning nation of Israel.

It makes sense Exodus 21 would be phrased as it is, and Leviticus 25, and everything else we've seen from this and other skeptics, so far as I've been able to find or have been confronted with in countless online conversations with them, etc.

Parsimoniously, it LOOKS like Israel really didn't like slavery, had a very low view of themselves and a generally high view of foreigners, might have been tempted to flip that around as a get-back-at-them thing but God warned against that in sweeping categorical ways that cover ALL subjects and OFTEN are in contexts of this same freeing of Israel from slavery (!), and had several strong statements in Exodus 21, Leviticus 25, and Deuteronomy 23 that ban all aspects of what the skeptic means when he says "there is no good slavery there is no nice slavery" -- that these are here because God COULD "get away with" banning slavery.

Note that what Jesus brought up the hardhearted point on was divorce for reasons beyond legitimate reasons.

This would suggest automatically that it might expand to other gender issues -- it would NOT suggest inherently that it extends to slavery.

Skeptics may be conflating in their mind modern race-based slavery and seeing all identity issues as the same, but in ancient times, slavery wasn't inherently about race anyways, and their own arguments here depend on conceding that, although to be fair, the later Egyptian treatment of Israel was very much an us vs. them thing.


What about the OTHER things God demanded?

Let's start with the 10Cs.

1: God just led them OUT from slavery. He says:

/Exo 20:2 -
“I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of [fn]slavery. 3 - “You shall have no other gods [fn]before Me./

We haven't even gotten past the VERY FIRST THOU SHALT NOT (KJV bomb there), and we ALREADY see a suggestion that slavery is bad!

Now the skeptics will often say things like "OH BUT OH BUT OH BUT ITSH ONLY FOR FOREIGNERS ITSH ALLOWED/CONDONED" but "slavery is slavery". Then "OH BUT SLAVERY IS SLAVERY SURE but for foreigners it was slavery allowed and slavery banned for Israelites!" (Despite the same word being used for Hebrews in places! So is an ebed an ebed?) And so on. I'm not, though, arguing that THIS passage weighs in all that clearly, but it is very WEIRD if the skeptic's portrayal is accurate.

Most people who haven't read the Bible and hear skeptic claims that it's pro-slavery should be very surprised, if they're paying attention, here.

In any case, for the "you shall have no" (the "thou shalt have no" KJV), this God just freed them from cruel slavery; why would they see this as too great an imposition per se? Even though this is the one we see some of the clearest cases of their rebellion against, such as the golden calf even with this same group just a little while later than this, it makes sense that enough of them would eventually be open to this.

Keep in mind this first generation of the time MOSTLY rebelled, in fact, about 2 years later when they arrived at the Promised Land (not 40 years later... cult of dusty silliness... which ironically Josh Bowen also fell for, showing his lack of credibility by the way, in a video where someone else claimed that the Bible is wrong to say it takes 40 years to get from Egypt to Canaan, as Josh Bowen just sat there and didn't say it was a bad argument... but I digress).

It was the SECOND generation that was largely loyal enough to really strongly ground things, who had grown up hearing about what God had done, seeing the manna provided constantly and so forth. They would have plenty of reason to find this a reasonable command.

It was also normal that once you have your own land, there would be a diety of that land. Even if some didn't understand that this wasn't just another limited small-g god, this wouldn't be a weird imposition.

It might seem weird to them that their pantheon has only one deity in it, and they again might want to expand it by borrowing from others around, but pantheons varied in many ways, and what categories of life each god covered varied, so it wouldn't be that much of a stretch to believe in an ultimate God over everything, even if it was just the most powerful and highest-ranking small-g god. All the more so if it's the unlimited God; he certainly could understandably have a right to have SOME place where he gets his own solely-devoted people.

So no, this isn't too much of an imposition.

Next is no idols. Same as the first, just clarifying against the negative side. Don't take God's name in vain, again, reasonable all on the same grounds.

Keep the sabbath holy -- this actually gives them a break from work! It can be an imposition, especially when distorted to the extremes that were seen in extrabiblical additions in NT era. But in general it would be welcomed, and it's grounded in creation and it's normal for a covenant to have some kind of ritual signs that go with it.

The Mosaic theme is often to take that idea and run with it. If any society were to accept that principle, then it would be difficult to point to any one in particular and say this one's out. You could just blindly assume no such society would do that, but if this God is real, surely he could providentially lead to that being the society he calls, and even use selection here to do that. He selects the man, Abraham, and others later, who he knows from his middle knowledge would lead to this.

Honor father, mother. This would be desired by the older people among the society, those more likely to be in control of it.

Don't murder. Other than murderers, this would be embraced.

Don't commit adultery. There would certainly be many who would find this an imposition! But MANY others understand the wrongness of it, the pain it can cause, etc.

Don't steal -- those most successful would likely want this. Societal drivers wouldn't like their stuff stolen. Even everyday people presumably wouldn't want their own things taken, even if they were tempted to take another's.

Don't bear false witness against your neighbor. This is more likely to be an imposition in various ways by societal drivers, but also would have plenty who wouldn't want it done to them.

Don't covet. I'll quote it in a bit since "slave" is in it. But this one is a serious imposition, but also internal and difficult to prove. They might be annoyed by it, if they really like them some coveting, but if they don't act on it by stealing and so on, they could tolerate it being in the rules and trying to hide their coveting.

/Exo 20:17 -
“You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife or his male slave or his female slave or his ox or his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”/

This one our typical skeptics like to use to try to claim that women and ebeds and amahs are "things" or "livestock" (as THIS skeptic DID use!). Of course, this just begs the question.

Nothing here looks comparable to the situation where IF Israel hardheartedly "loves me some slavery" to the point that God had to begrudgingly allow it (remember, the ULTIMATE God, if we DO objectively prove ANYTHING wrong, is independantly PROVEN to agree that thing is wrong, no matter what it is, whether he says it or not, and we ALWAYS have to keep in mind he knows better than we do when to choose his battles when dealing with the freewill problem), that then God banning it might legitimately make them reject the whole covenant.

Slavery, even by the chattel definition, targeted those most on the outs with various societies, those even their own societies, if they were from others, didn't want or care about if they were enslaved, and it helped society-drivers to have easier, less expensive lives. It didn't directly affect the relatively successful among the everyman.

How is this comparable?

I'm not saying Israel DID love them some slavery, again. But EVEN IF I'm wrong that they were generally easily anti-slavery (anti chattel slavery, anti any other negative sense etc.), the skeptic STILL has no legitimate argument here.




Okay, now let's finish setting up the definition in Miller.

When he lists the features of what he will call chattel slavery, I'm NOT saying that if we only disprove SOME of them were true of the Bible (the objectionable features, of course -- things like "being under an authority in some sense" aren't inherently bad), and it's still the case for at least one feature, that the Bible gets a pass.

I'm doing this just to close this out (for now unless we go on to other things like looking at Exodus 21 in more detail) with what GM did the work on already to cut through the ambiguity of the word and show the features.

And this is independant of any need for the skeptic to actually have what GM calls "New World slavery" in mind; even if they are NOT projecting on that, GM can validly look at that to help build a list of features.

Skipping forward a little:

(quote)Accordingly, I think--to avoid the inflammatory associations that naturally occur for Westerners when something is referred to as 'slavery'--it wise to carefully set out the structure of what we consider 'slavery' today, and compare that to the OT institution of 'Hebrew slavery'. New World slavery differs substantially from most ANE institutions labeled 'slavery', which themselves differed at significant points from OT slavery. We will try to make these distinctions clear, when they are relevant to the discussion.

With this in mind, I want to set out the basic elements associated with historical slavery, as practiced in America before the American Civil War, and to offer some general contrasts with ANE slavery (I will look at OT slavery later in the article). (This is not meant to be exhaustive, but simply to highlight the aspects of the institution that strike our sensibilities today.)(quote)

I'll try to limit what I quote from the rest just to what clarifies the "diagnostic features" of what we COULD use to define "slavery" when we use the approach of "slavery is bad, Bible only condones servanthood" (the approach JPH has used).

I won't worry about ANE slavery here, just to list the fullest idea of what can count as negative slavery, or closer to the fullest for not spending a ton of time on this.

But all should read that (go to GM's place on the global weblike thingy, slash, q no slave, without spaces).

He does show that the norm in the region wasn't much like at least some of these features (so it wouldn't be weird that Israel's "ebed" and "amah" systems weren't either). I'll include a bit about that, some of his summaries, but not the extensive work he shows to back it up lest I just end up reproducing his entire article basically.

(quote)· Motive: Slavery was motivated by the economic advantage of the elite.

So, [NS:ECA:4:1190] point this out: "New World slavery was a unique conjunction of features. Its use of slaves was strikingly specialized as unfree labor-producing commodities, such as cotton and sugar, for a world market." and Britannica: "By 1850 nearly two-thirds of the plantation slaves were engaged in the production of cotton...the South was totally transformed by the presences of slavery. Slavery generated profits comparable to those from other investments and was only ended as a consequence of the War Between the States." (s.v. "Slavery")

In the ANE (and OT), this was NOT the case. The dominant (statistically) motivation was economic relief of poverty (i.e., 'slavery' was initiated by the slave--NOT by the owner--and the primary uses were purely domestic (except in cases of State slavery, where individuals were used for building projects).(end quote)

(quote)· Entry: Slavery was overwhelmingly involuntary. Humans were captured by force and sold via slave-traders.

This was true both for the Islamic slave trade and the European trade. [...]

In the ANE (and especially the OT), the opposite was the case. This should be obvious from the MOTIVE aspect--these were choices by the impoverished to enter this dependency state, in return for economic security and protection. Some slavery contracts actually emphasized this voluntary aspect!(end quote)

The "[...]" is and will be my own ellipsis. Other uses of square brackets and/or ellipses are in GM's article like one below. If I have notes to add I'll instead end the quote or pause it, as I'm also doing after each feature.

(quote)· Treatment : Slaves were frequently mistreated by modern standards, and punishments were extreme.

The images we have of the Old American South are filled with mistreatments, and we need no documentation of that here.

The ANE, on the other hand, was much less severe, due largely to the differences in the attitudes of the 'master' to the 'slave'. Slavery in the ANE was much more an 'in-house' and 'in-family' thing, with closer emotional attachment.

However, there were still some extreme punishments in the ANE, but the biblical witness is of a decidedly better environment for slaves than even the ANE.

Exodus 21, for example, is considered by many to be unparalleled in respect to humanitarianism toward slaves, and we shall return to this in detail below.

[Suffice it to mention here that Ex 21.21 restricts the treatment of the slave to be no more severe than what the community/elders could do with a regular, free citizen. This restriction on an owner should make one ponder what in the world the word 'property' might mean in such a context! But more on this in a minute…(end quote)

(quote)· Treatment : As a matter of course, slaves lived in radical separation from their owners and did not participate in many of the 'benefits' of the owners' fortunes.

We have already noted that in New World slavery at least two-thirds of plantation slaves would have lived in barracks (field-slaves), and not in intimacy with owners (domestics), whereas in the ANE/OT, the vast majority of the slaves were domestics under the same roof. In the ANE/OT, we don’t have the 'gangs' of agricultural workers we will see later in Republican Rome and in the New World(end quote)

GM says treatment twice as a bulletpoint, unsure if that's meant to be two separate features or elaborating. They're both left-aligned the same way as the other bulletpointed features. He might have copypasted the format and forgot to edit?

The second could be called instead Habitation.

(quote)· Legal Status : Slaves were considered 'property' in exclusion to their humanity.

That is, to fire a bullet into a slave was like firing a bullet into a pumpkin, not like firing a bullet into a human.

There were no legal or ethical demands upon owners' as to how they treated their 'property'. Other than with the occasional benevolent master, only economic value was a main deterrent to abusive treatment.

Theoretically, some expressions of New World slavery had some protection from outright murder of a slave, but this was not very widely accepted:

"In the American South, 10 codes prescribed forced sale to another owner or emancipation for maltreated slaves. Nevertheless, cases such as State v. Hoover (North Carolina, 1839) and State v. Jones (Alabama, 1843) were considered sensational because slave owners were punished for savagely 'correcting' their slaves to death." [Britannica] [...]

Now, this restriction on an owner as to what he/she could do with their personal 'property' should make us wonder about how the word 'property' is being used there. And indeed, the definition of 'property'--in the context of slavery--gives Anthropologists pause:

"The definition of slaves as property runs into conceptual as well as empirical problems. 'Property' is a shorthand and abstract term for a bundle of very specific and relatively exclusive rights held by a person (or group) relative to a thing (or person).

To say that in any given society, something (say, a person) is 'property' has meaning only to the extent that the rights involved are specified and understood in the context of other rights prevalent in the society.

For example, in many precolonial African societies, the kin group had the right to sell equally its slave and nonslave members, it had equal control over the wealth acquired by either of them, it extracted (or failed to extract) as much labor from one as from the other, and the majority of slaves were quasi-relatives or actual relatives, and, if prosperous enough, could acquire slaves of their own.

Here, obviously, one must look at other features to find the difference between the slave and the 'free'." [NS:ECA:4:1191, s.v. "Slavery"] [...]

And this implied range of freedom/slavery can be seen all over the ANE. Buying and Selling, for example, can be the contractual terminology for child adoption:

"Older children were adopted by reimbursing their parents for the expenses of feeding and raising them. These transactions were recorded as if they were sales." [HI:DLAM:131]

and slaves had very specific legal rights (can real 'chattel property' have such?):

"Slaves had certain legal rights: they could take part in business, borrow money, and buy their freedom." [HI:DLAM:118]

"Guterbock refers to 'slaves in the strict sense,' apparently referring to chattel slaves such as those of classical antiquity.

This characterization may have been valid for house slaves whose master could treat them as he wished when they were at fault, but it is less suitable when they were capable of owning property and could pay betrothal money or fines.

The meaning 'servant' seems more appropriate, or perhaps the designation 'semi-free'.

It comprises every person who is subject to orders or dependent on another but nonetheless has a certain independence within his own sphere of active." [HI:HANEL:1632]

"However, the idea of a slave as exclusively the object of rights and as a person outside regular society was apparently alien to the laws of the ANE." [REF:ABD, s.v. "Slavery, Ancient Near East"]

One other important distinction has to do with how 'comprehensive' or exclusive was the 'property' aspect. In other words, to what extent was a slave only property, and not also, a human, a family member, a contracting agent. In the ANE at least, slavery was generally a mixture of these aspects--they were not ONLY property per se [HI:HANEL:1.40]: [...]

A less dramatic illustration of this might be in a modern acquisition of one business by another business.

I the employee--a 'bundle' of all my workplace obligations, the contract under which I work, the values I am supposed to uphold, the relationships I have with co-workers at the office, my skills, my organizational knowledge, and my career path in the firm--is 'sold' to other owning group (e.g., competitor, private investor, Wall Street, etc).

There is, in this case, a 'property' aspect to my life-at-the-office.

This does not mean, of course, that my family status as a dad is changed, or that I cannot vote in my country.

My role and/or identity as a worker could thus be 'sold', 'transferred', and even 'inherited' (e.g., if the firm was privately owned, and the owner died with a successor).

Our legal system recognizes this in many, many contracts under the heading "Successors and Assigns".

But wherever I went, the state would still see me as a human, and prevent--as in the ANE-- my 'owner' from killing me.(end quote)

I quoted a lot of that, some crucial points there, especially near the end, starting with "A less dramatic", which I have split to several paragraphs but was all GM's last paragraph in that section.

That section especially highlights the absurd hypocrisy of skeptics in realizing that the situations he described there aren't objectionable just because they have features like inheritance and selling, yet they scream that those same features prove the Bible to be supposedly pro-slavery.

Next he uses Legal Status again so I'm thinking it's more likely he's intentionally using header terms multiple times. The above one could be called Personhood; it's about property in the sense of whether the "slave" is considered property, what that means, and whether the slave is also anything else like a human being with equal worth and basic rights or not.

The below one I'm having more time thinking of a single word for. I just ran it through AI and I'll pick "Economic Agency" although it's two words.

This one is about, for example, if the "slave" can accumulate money, can the owner spend it? That could be relevant if there's a society where you CAN buy your freedom, so if your stuff is your master's stuff, the master can game the system by spending your money if it's ever getting too close to the amount that can buy your freedom.

(quote)· Legal Status : Slaves could not have their own property--all they had belonged to their 'owner'.

"In North America, India, Rome, Muscovy, most of the Islamic world, and among the Tuareg a fundamental principle was that the slave could not own property because the master owned not only his slave's body but everything that body might accumulated. This did not mean, however, that slaves could not possess and accumulate property but only that their owners had legal title to whatever the slaves had. In a host of other societies, such as ancient and Roman Egypt, Babylonia, Assyria, Talmudic Palestine, Gortyn, much of medieval German, Thailand, Mongol and Ch'ing China, medieval Spain, and the northern Nigerian emirates, slaves had the right of property ownership. Some places, such as Rome, allowed slaves to accumulate, manage, and use property in a peculium that was legally revocable but could be used to purchase their freedom." [Britannica]

[Note: As pointed out in the quote about the fuzziness of 'property' above (by the Cultural Anthropologists), there is a little 'play' in this word, But a strict delineation of what was and what was not 'property', and/or what was and was not 'owned', was established and determined by the governing body of the specific situation. For example, in the ante-bellum South, it would have been the law courts in that time and in that geographical jurisdiction which decided, and they would have invariably sided with the slave owner instead of the slave as to whether, for example, the bed the slave slept on belonged to him or to his owner. [...]

"Sometimes slaves [in the ANE] were permitted to possess various kinds of property (peculium). Naturally, a slave received the right to a peculium only in those cases when the master took an interest in this.

Such slaves were left to themselves with the payment of a fixed quitrent [tanknote: a 'quitrent' is a fee paid by the slave to the owner, so that the slave doesn’t have to work any more for the owner, during the period covered by this 'rent to quit working'. It's like a substitution of money for labor].

The size of the quitrent fluctuated depending on the property of the slave, and in 1st-millennium Babylonia, on average, when calculated in money, amounted to twelve shekels of silver a year. [...]
.(end quote)

Next I'll quote the last one in its entirety, as well as the short section starting with "Garnsey identifies" that closed out GM's build of the feature list, then I'll again summarize the features with my terms for the topics/questions and again quote just the header summaries GM had for each, and then try to build an even shorter list of terms for the possible negatives.

(quote)· Exit : Slavery was forever. There were never any means of obtaining freedom stipulated in the arrangement. In the cases of an owner granting freedom, it was generally a 'bare bones' release--no property went with the freedman.

"…in the American South manumission was comparatively difficult and almost never happened after the prohibition on importing new slaves…manumission was even forbidden in South Carolina in 1820, Mississippi in 1822, Arkansas in 1858, and Maryland and Alabama in 1860…" [Britannica]

In the ANE, although some cultures had pre-built "debt-payoff-periods" (like Israel's 6 years), "chattel" manumission was rare because it wasn’t sought after--the issues of economic security and the quasi-family relationships that developed within the household unit created little incentive to become 'independent':

"More usually, individual autonomy has meant exposure to danger and predation; safety lay precisely in the protection afforded by the bondage of dependence on groups and patrons. What was desirable was not freedom but belongingness." [NS:ECA:4.1191]

[We will be semi-shocked below when we discover that manumission in Israel was either pre-scheduled (in the case of Hebrew slaves) or anytime-you-want-it (in the case of foreign slaves)…!]
 

Garnsey identifies many of these elements in his understanding of what he terms 'chattel slavery' [HI:ISAA:1]:

"A slave was property. The slaveowner's rights over his slave-property were total, covering the person as well as the labor of the slave. The slave was kinless, stripped of his or her old social identity in the process of capture, sale and deracination, and denied to capacity to forge new bonds of kinship through marriage alliance. These are the three basic components of slavery."(end quote)


After that Miller gets into how the Bible structured what is often called "slavery". I'm not sure if I'll go over his work on that here or not, for now I'm not planning to. Let's just work on the list of features.

Here square brackets will be for my replacements in three of his duplicated terms (for the themes/questions). I can switch to just using quote marks since his use of them for his block quotes (the only part of that preserved in my copypastes from his article) aren't used in his section-header paragraphs per feature.




Diagnostic feature categories of slavery:

"· Motive: Slavery was motivated by the economic advantage of the elite."

"· Entry: Slavery was overwhelmingly involuntary. Humans were captured by force and sold via slave-traders."

"· Treatment : Slaves were frequently mistreated by modern standards, and punishments were extreme."

"· [Habitation] : As a matter of course, slaves lived in radical separation from their owners and did not participate in many of the 'benefits' of the owners' fortunes."

"· [Personhood] : Slaves were considered 'property' in exclusion to their humanity.

That is, to fire a bullet into a slave was like firing a bullet into a pumpkin, not like firing a bullet into a human.

There were no legal or ethical demands upon owners' as to how they treated their 'property'. Other than with the occasional benevolent master, only economic value was a main deterrent to abusive treatment."

That was all one paragraph in GM, I had split it up. There are actually several major themes/questions in here. Of course that's true of all of these to some extent. But note that as far as "property" goes, GM is NOT saying that words that could be translated as "property" or "silver" as in some verses in the Bible intrinsically make this slavery, nor does Garnsey's use of the sentence "A slave was property" imply that.

By "Personhood" here I mean the "plus" in what GM had mentioned when he said that some definitions of slaves as property didn't intend this to deny all or some aspects of personhood. So, property plus personhood? That would be the question here.

We could also add a theme question of whether a person under authority IS considered "property" in some sense and what does it mean.

Since "ebed" can be used of people like Abraham, or as we saw in Exodus 20, in a sense all Israel is bought as a slave and still owned by the Lord, but many people (though not some of the rabid "Bible is pro-slavery" skeptics) would say this isn't anything like slavery, when we use the term "slavery" for these negative diagnostic features.

So we could add something like this:

· Property: Slaves were considered property.

As a yes/no thing if we define "property" as something distinct from what a society calls "free" and "not a 'slave'" (or not some term that we might translate slave).

Also, for those who are considered slaves and fully human or have personhood to some extent, pro-slavery arguers might say that the slave, in a case where the slave, they would claim, can be shot into like into a pumpkin and that there should be no serious legal punishment for doing so, would still be "human pumpkins" akin to what many skeptics do to the unborn, or even as some admit of the unborn persons, but I mean, more like, how relevant to their legal rights should their humanity and personhood be?

That would be a clearer definnition of what the Personhood theme question is about, as well as whether they ARE persons or not.

So for example in GM's point about a merger where his work contract is sold and bought, and could even be inherited, and is property of the owner of the business, he still has full personhood and full legal rights just like anyone else in our society. But he himself isn't the property; it's his work contract, in a major relevant sense.

(It's also been shown that in English, though, at least at one time, there was also a sense of "property" that had no intrinsic negative connotations and could be applied to people. In that sense GM IS property even in our society in his employment and would be in this merger analogy.)

I think we can add a third as well because I think also tied up in this is the crucial aspect of a right to life, separate from treatment (which the "I can shoot a pumpkin" thing would also apply to; "I can whip a pumpkin" but the latter would be under the Treatment section above).

· Killing: Slaves could be killed. (With possibly some legal ramifications but some cases were shown where they were allowed to be killed, and cases where it was considered objectionable that killers were punished at all.)

"· [Economic Agency] : Slaves could not have their own property--all they had belonged to their 'owner'."

"· Exit : Slavery was forever. There were never any means of obtaining freedom stipulated in the arrangement. In the cases of an owner granting freedom, it was generally a 'bare bones' release--no property went with the freedman."








Above is the list of theme questions, with the theme terms (not inherently negative because it's about asking how each is handled), and with paragraphs (from GM where in quote marks) answering how the worst examples answered the questions (what the anti-Bible accuser's desired definition of "slave" would be). 

I'm not claiming that list is exhaustive or that every sub-question is reflected in the summary. But this moves us toward a working list.


Let's try to condense it even further now.

"Slavery" features (NOT automatically true of all "ebed"s or "amah"s in OT, or whatever the NT Greek word(s) are):

- Motive: elites' economic advantage.

- Entry: involuntary, captured by force, sold via slave-traders.

- Treatment: mistreated, punishments extreme.

- Habitation: lived separate from owners, didn't participate in benefits of owners' fortunes.

- Personhood: human rights were diminished or seen as irrelevant to extreme extent.

- Property: were owned in a way distinct from 'free' in their society.

- Killing: could be killed, little to no legal consequences.

- Economic Agency: master claimed ownership also of the slave's belongings, including inanimate things, animals, and, if the slave could own slaves, them too.

- Exit: Forever, virtually always, other than bought and freed, which in some cases is banned.


We could also add these:

- Allowances: (I didn't notice if he commented for the worst cases but we'll say no. ANE generally yes.)

- Salaries: not given these. (This is true of OT ebeds evidently. On this point, the definition does legitimately overlap the OT.

- Sellers (as in, was the person paid for selling themselves into "slavery"? Or was someone else being paid? And if so, who was that? Family? Someone whose job is to sell slaves?)

- Room and Board: yes, generally given these. In worst cases, it's confinement, which we should add a point for too.

In OT often this was the replacement for salaries and was a positive social safety net system, mentioning because normal modern jobs do NOT even get this usually! So a denial of being given this doesn't even today imply a negative. So, salaries and room and board are treated as somewhat equivalent; you can have one but not the other, in a "good" arrangement, in the usual modern view.

- Confinement: worst cases yes. OT no. Often in modern sex slavery, chains, etc.






This is all a reply to that one skeptic, and other things brought up along the way. At this time I don't have time to try to write a full ideal analysis to settle the matter for all time, but that's a start for a category list that could be used to help diagnose the different systems in the Bible, in combination with whole-Bible survey notes collecting, line by line, anything we notice that might seem relevant first, then plugging the total results into that kind of a list.

That could be done for:

1) Mosaic Law (ML) "debt" or "otherwise would be about to be in debt" "slavery" in the OT system (indentured servitude).

2) ML war criminals.

3) ML other criminals.

4) NT, whatever it gives advice to slaves and to masters about, if discernible.

Though in the NT case it isn't about setting up a system but about how to behave since the system is enforced by Rome/etc.; this isn't Christians in charge and defining an ideal, even if the OT would have been, which I don't think it was intended to do, even with the evidence that our diagnostic feature definition of slavery was NOT desired for the most part or allowed in OT law (other than in a sense for criminals but for more obviously justified reasons that we sitll use today to an extent and most don't object to).

It could also be used to chart basics for things like the Babylonian system, the Roman system itself, Egyptian at time of Moses, or modern jobs, the example of the modern company merger, things like modern prison systems or the military even, etc.

Also could look at the original Genesis pattern, and any evidence of anything between then and Moses. My focus has so far been more on the Mosaic law (Sinai to death of Moses) though, but that's a covenant and I also focus on early Genesis, and on the other covenants leading up to the Mosaic, and the Christian covenant.

Other diagnostic features would probably need to be added though.


Ideally I'd like to someday have time to go about such a thing. I had old notes from my whole-Sinai-to-MoDeath two studies so far, though it would be a ton of work to go through those, plus do all the rest. So maybe instead just another whole-Bible survey, but I have many others planned and other tasks so who knows when/if that will actually happen.

In the meantime, everything here could be useful for an initial summary of my past findings and where I'm currently at on this topic, and covering many of the common points.
