# HueLetters

HueLetters is an alphabet code system of 24 hues (plus black, white, and clear) that, except for clear, fit into the 26 letters of the English alphabet. It's the result of many years of development and tweaking to get it to a system that as of 2024.06.14 seems to be about as ideal as it will get, good enough to post here.

Eventually I would like to expand this page to put full justifications for each one, but that's difficult and the mental process for it is often nonlinear so difficult to express in text.

In short it involved a lot of googling of color names in these ranges and trying out a wide range of which ones get used for which hue and what the resulting color alphabet will be. Keep in mind that means which hue goes with which letter still might possibly change, but at this point it's less likely.

This latest version preserves ROYGBIV, RGB, and CMYK since those are popular, well-established systems, compatible with each other, and also bases itself around a "hue compass" used as a cultural signpost system for my fictional world of my WIP edutainment stories (see [here](Cipher#fictional-language-systems-in-my-work-in-progess-edutainment-series)).

Like the other systems described on or linked to from that page, it's part of the Cipher Art Language, almost all parts of which are intended to also have real-world practical value, while also existing in-story.

HueLetters specifically is a development of a system I used to use to abbreviate and easily track mixes of hues of Sculpy (a color claylike product) when I was a kid, so that I could reproduce them later.

I also use the color names that end up chosen to explain charts/lists of hues in the related Cipher system (not English-based) of HueGlyphs, part of Cipher Thoughtglyphs (see the [Cipher](Cipher) page for more).

## Development Basics

Here are the other notes showing the system I used to develop this (very basic summaries; the text file that had this was part of the process and was shifted around a lot during the process; this is the form it ended up in), with headers and some explanations added.

The intro from the notes file:

In the comma-separated lists below, the first one listed (the one with the check mark) is final, the other rejected candidates are still shown, if any, later in the comma-separated list.

First hue list shows the color wheel divided into 8 for compass directions, hue second list accommodates the more 3-based division of RGB as well as a 24-hour clock option, including all the 8-division options.

Following that are the other letter assignments beyond basic hues.

After that, the list of everything shown again but arranged alphabetically. All of those lists include rejected candidates, and were maintained during decision process simultaneously so should agree.

Then a summary of rules followed.

One further note: During the form of this that I had until the day I'm posting this article version, I was using \# for clear, but today realized it doesn't work as well since it's used in color hex codes (hexadecimal), plus I would have to escape it with a backslash every time when writing the code for this GitHub Pages (with Jekyll) Markdown-to-HTML site since in Markdown \# is a header code, so switched to underscore. I'll try to update the notes accordingly but if I miss anything that's why.

### Hue Compass (8-division; HueCompass, HuCp)

Hue compass is a term in-story for a system of glowing road indicators that let you know easily even in overcast conditions at night (for example) which compass direction the side of the road you're on goes to.

- North 0°/360° FF0000 -- <b>✓ R Red</b>
  - Northeast 45° FFBF00 -- <b>✓ D Dandelion</b>, A Amber
- East 90° 80FF00 -- <b>✓ L Lime</b>
  - Southeast 135° 00FF40 -- <b>✓ J Jade</b>, E Erin
- South 180° 00FFFF -- <b>✓ C Cyan</b>
  - Southwest 225° 0040FF -- <b>✓ T cobalT blue</b>
- West 270° 8000FF -- <b>✓ V Violet</b> (but in-story this can still be called purple informally), U pUrple, P Purple
  - Northwest 315° FF00BF -- <b>✓ N piNk</b>, I pInk, P Pink

In-story, roads that curve would really have a whole color circle of ranges potentially, but reserving just those 8 was part of an attempt to let the NEWS of North East West South be reserved for a shorter version. This didn't work, though, as no easily recognizeable color worked for hue angle 315 other than the generic name "pink," "I" was reserved for Indigo from ROYGBIV, K for blacK from CMYK, and I felt P works better for Pear.

Still, it would generally be clear if EWS are reserved for directions, and I did avoid overlap otherwise, within the 8 version.

### Hue 24-Hours Clock (24-division; HueHours, HuHr)

The HueHours system could be used for a 24-hour clock arrangement of a color circle.

- 0°/360° FF0000 (North) -- ✓ R Red
      - 15° FF4000 -- ✓ U Umber (burnt Umber), V Vermillion, F Flame
    - 30° FF7F00 -- ✓ O Orange
      - 45° FFBF00 (Northeast) -- ✓ D Dandelion, A Amber
  - 60° FFFF00 -- ✓ Y Yellow
      - 75° BFFF00 -- ✓ P Pear
    - 90° 80FF00 (East) -- ✓ L Lime
      - 105° 40FF00 -- ✓ H Harlequin
- 120° 00FF00 -- ✓ G Green
      - 135° 00FF40 (Southeast) -- ✓ J Jade, E Erin
    - 150° 00FF7F -- ✓ S Spring green
      - 165° 00FFBF -- ✓ Q aQuamarine, T Turquoise
  - 180° 00FFFF (South) -- ✓ C Cyan
      - 195° 00BFFF -- ✓ X sky-blue (sk->ks->X), CZ Cyan-aZure
    - 210° 0080FF -- ✓ Z aZure, A Azure
      - 225° 0040FF (Southwest) -- ✓ T cobalT blue
- 240° 0000FF -- ✓ B Blue
      - 255° 4000FF -- ✓ I Indigo, BU Blue-pUrple, N iNdigo
    - 270° 8000FF (West) -- ✓ V Violet, U pUrple, P Purple
      - 285° BF00FF -- ✓ F Fuschia
  - 300° FF00FF -- ✓ M Magenta
      - 315° FF00BF (Northwest) -- ✓ N piNk, I pInk, P Pink
    - 330° FF0080 -- ✓ E rosE, S roSe
      - 345° FF0040 -- ✓ A Amaranth, ER rosE-Red

Others:
- ✓ K blacK 000000
- ✓ W White FFFFFF, H wHite FFFFFF
- ✓ _ clear (transparent), X clear, \# clear

I consider black, white, and clear to be part of the HueHours version of HueLetters, although they aren't hues of course. They're the remainder after 24 hues are all assigned.

Here's the process used for arrive at the number 24.

First I started by dividing a full color circle into 3, for RGB (Red, Green, Blue), the system used most basically for computer colors, also matching the color cones in human eyes, for the first level (the bulletpoints in the following list that aren't indented at all).

RGB also forms the basic points of the HueGlyphs symbol that's part of Cipher ThoughtGlyphs.

The other popular color system, for printer pigments, is CMYK, for Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and K for blacK (since B is taken by the RGB system). Removing black for now to focus just on hues, for the second level (bulletpoints indented once), I used the colors that are halfway between those (I divided by 2).

Putting those in the same order as RGB, that's then YCM; Yellow, Cyan, Magenta.

Then I divided that by two again for the third level, and again for the fourth.

So, the total divisions is the hue circle /3 (divided by 3), /2, /2, and once more /2. (/3/2/2/2.)

For the third and fourth level, I start with what's left from ROYGBIV, the mnemonic many people know, not already in RGB or CMYK, which leaves O Orange, I Indigo, and V Violet.

Orange is a third-level, between a 1st-level (Red) and a 2nd-level (Yellow). Same with Violet, between Blue and Magenta. Indigo is fourth-level, which is defined as anything between any of the higher levels, in this case between a 1st-level, Blue again, and between Violet.

Note that I have read it claimed that when ROYGBIV was first invented, "blue" used to mean what we now call azure, or including cyan ranges, while "indigo" used to refer more to what we now call "blue" in the RGB system. (So, on a rainbow, the "blue" that looks darker would have been called indigo, while the blue that's closer to green and looks brighter to the human eye would be called blue.)

I mention this to explain why I'll now clarify that this system uses only the modern definition; here "Blue" only means the Blue in the computer RGB system, the rightmost indicator in the hex code 0000FF (which means Red 0, Green 0, Blue 255; that is, Red 0%, Green 0%, Blue 100%).

For what was left, I then searched the options and listed the ones that did seem to me to genuinely be very close to the hex codes in question, checking that in Paint and the Leonardo art app, and fiddled with the arrangements of the comma-separated lists on each line to swap any that were in the way of a better overall alignment with the alphabet, allowing letters not at the start of a word to be assigned.

(For those cases, like Z for aZure, it's important to typically say the color abbreviation as the full "Z aZure" and if writing/typing it to leave the "a" uncapitalized in aZure and capitalize the Z. Though once this is clear you could just say Z, or just say azure without capitalizing the z.)

K for blacK was reserved from CMYK.

For White, options were W, H, T, or E, with W being preferred, or H (so I didn't bother listing T or E above), but it was put into the same decision-making process from among the remaining alphabetic letters with the other remaining hues. As it turned out, W worked okay for it.

Then since 26 letters had been all taken, it was left to figure out what keyboard character would work best for clear.

Well, at first, I was going to just have some letters not assigned to hues, so three of the fourth-level hues would have to use two-letter combos from the hues around them, leaving three I could reserve for other common colors, gray, brown, and clear, with X for clear. But then I realized that left me with only three un-assigned hues, and three remainder letters, and I realized I liked it better to have all 24 hues have a single letter.

Gray could be indicated with KW, following the same basic rules I had established as far back as the Sculpy notes system. Brown could also be called OK (Orange-blacK), although in practice most browns are somewhere in a broad range that include mixes of white, yellow, or red, not pure Orange.

So that left just clear as the only thing that couldn't otherwise be indicated. After rejecting # today, I ended up with _ underscore as the next-best option.

Note: If I refer to HueLetters, I normally mean HueHours unless otherwise specified.

Also note: The justification for "sky blue" being abbreviated with X is obviously less than ideal.

Virtually no color names that start with, or otherwise include, X, are well known enough for me to justify including. SK to KS to X is at least mnemonically useful. I have noticed though that a color called "Amazon Alexa Blue" is almost idential according to one website. You could perhaps call it Alexa blue, although you might not want to say it out loud if you have an Amazon Alexa. (X aleXa blue.)

Other comments could be made about issues with Fuschia versus Magenta, Violet versus purple, how the whole range of Pear to Green can be difficult to visually distinguish and similar for Blue and Indigo, and about the un-intuitiveness of using E for rosE, N for piNk, and how the precise hex codes have to be reinterpreted a bit for many like those to get them to align, but suffice to say, all alignments likely have problems and this is the one that had the least after years of a ton of work rethinking the system.

#### Alphabetic HueLetters (HueHours) List

This list was maintained in parallel to the 24-hues list (and other colors) and hue compass during development. Provided for completeness here.

X ✓ X sky-blue (sk->ks->X), clear [decanonized]<br>
Y ✓ Yellow 60°<br>
Z ✓ aZure 210°<br>

Note that "Umber" shouldn't be used as an abbreviation for U burnt Umber, although I did call it that on that list, since "umber" by itself is a more yellowish color. Technically both umber and burnt umber often refer to somewhat brownish colors but burnt umber is closer to orange-red / red-orange. I wanted Vermillion for it but to preserve ROYGBIV's V for Violet I couldn't.
