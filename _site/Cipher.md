# Cipher, Lingua, Syllabic, ThoughtGlyphs, Speakscript, & Related Systems
For the purposes of this text-based site, [Lingua](Lingua){:target="_blank"} is the most relevant, a keyboard-typeable pronunciation system.

"Cipher" refers both to the category containing all of the following systems, and to the "ThoughtGlyphs" group of systems (meanings-based, not sound-based). The reason for the large number of systems is to provide options for different purposes.

- **Cipher (Cf)**: a group of (mostly hand-drawn) language systems that clarify meanings and pronunciations of other languages.

  - **[Lingua](Lingua){:target="_blank"} (Ln) (Or SoundType (SdTp)**: Keyboard-typeable pronunciation spelling system.

  - Hand-drawn *Cipher Glyphs (CfGl)* systems:

    - **Syllabic (Sl) / SoundGlyphs (SdGl)**: Highly compact pronunciation system.

    - **Cipher ThoughtGlyphs (ThGl) Art Language**: Ideographs that portray meaning in a large ingredient-symbols system, like an alphabet for thoughts (albeit much larger than the English alphabet). Has various subsystems, and two main subcategories:

      - *Expanded/Categorical (CfE)*. The idea with Expanded is you don't need to know it, and if you use it in a work, you should use a symbol for a category the type of symbol is in, from Basic, then the category symbol, then the less-well-known symbol.

      - *Basic (CfB)*. Grammar symbols, typical nouns, adjectives, etc. This is the main Cipher ThoughtGlyphs system. "Cipher," again, may sometimes be used to refer primarily to this.
      
        It's more of a system of logical rules and guidelines, designed to be intuitive to memorize and very clear, making strategic use of whitespace or contrast with it for some key symbols like the verb system or sentence delimiters, and a major set of rules called the "dot compression" system that allows simple dots to have a variety of clear meanings depending on contextual symbols.
        
        It has several important subsystems, some of them not really having their own names currently, but the named ones are:

        - *CountGlyphs (CtGl)* (or *Numeric (Nm)*): Math symbols. This comes with a variety of number systems, some just logical arrangements of dots so you could tell what number is meant by sight with no explanation, others for compact shorthand. Also various symbols for math operators/etc. fixing some problems of lack of clarity in normal English systems.

        - *TuneGlyphs (TnGl)*: Music notation system, integrated with standard musical systems, with a few different options that can portray the meaning of notes, expanding on the Countglyphs numeric system.

        - *HueGlyphs (HuGl)*: System using the "dot compression" rule from Basic to easily protray all basic colors using very condensed symbols. Also comes with a standard system for English letter codes, expanding on RGB CMYK, for a typeable option.

  - *Cipher Scripts (CfSc)* systems:

    - *SpellScript (SlSc)*: This is simply a hand-drawn "font," or can be used that way, indicating spellings of words only. Its purpose is to be distinct from the following two systems.

    - *SoundScript (SdSc)*: A hand-drawn phonetic alphabet designed to be intuitive to English speakers, something none of the existing real-world phonetic alphabets like IPA do.

      Also related:

      - *SoundType (SdTp)*: I never did finalize this but I've made many attempts to put together a workable version of SoundScript using only Unicode characters, that resemble the look of the sounds to English speakers (of the StAE dialect). Eventually I may add it to a subpage linked from here.
      
        The design of SoundScript, SpeakScript (below), and Syllabic / SoundGlyphs has been heavily influenced by this early development, so that they could have some consistent similarities.

    - **SpeakScript (SkSc)**: A fusion of spellings and sounds from the previous two, mainly used for hand-drawn captions of illustrations that indicate both the original English spelling and the pronunciation in StAE.

        


## Using Cipher/etc.

**You may (<i>yes, may</i>) use Cipher systems <i>without attribution</i>, as long as you don't claim them as your own.**

It may be best to attribute them to me, by me email address: <a href="mailto:idealparable@gmail.com"><b>idealparable@gmail.com</b></a>.

Remember, if you know who I am, please don't pass that information along. Refer to me only by "ideal parable" / "idealparable" or the whole email address, please. I don't agree with giving out personal information online.

## Purpose of Cipher linguistic systems

The purpose is dual:

1. **First, so that it can be used for Bible study purposes, or notes translating any language, or similar uses**.

    For example, versions of the figures and symbols for objects in the surrounding can be adapted into art, for the ThoughtGlyphs "art language," such as illustrations for use in Sunday School lessons.

    I see potential also perhaps for Bible translation? Such as in the missionary field? ThoughtGlyphs is in fact inspired by the (less artistic-looking) "SUN" (Symbolic Universal Notation) system developed for existing uses like that.
  
    I have no direct connection to that field, though, so I have no control over that, and it does have the downside of requiring to be hand-drawn (I use a touchscreen stylus in, for now, the Leonardo infinite-canvas Windows app, although I've recently noticed it tends to freeze up on my new Windows 11 computer; Windows 10 didn't have that problem, and it's unclear whether the developer is still working on it or not, after having promised a new version a long time ago, as of 2024).
  
    But once someone visited our church involved in that and he mentioned that during process work, planning, etc, he likes to illustrate concepts on a whiteboard just temporarily.
  
    Cipher (ThoughtGlyphs) is designed to be ideal for precisely that sort of purpose.

2. Second, I'm slowly working on a sort of edutainment science fiction adventure story series, which will use (I intend, we'll see if I succeed) good character-driven storytelling as a highly extended sort of parable teaching important things like logic and Christian apologetics. The world within the story has characters who fictionally developed Cipher for their own needs in-story.

    Progress is slow, as the goal is to try to make it as ideal as possible. I'm not sure the title is final yet, and I would rather not reveal any other details at all right now, other than the Cipher systems themselves.

    Related to that, some other linguistic systems exist in-story that for now I haven't included here, such as "Wherean" (Wh) a system for converting English labels for a place into more interesting-sounding fictional worlds (an in-story system, as the setting is tied to modern English society but with a fictional branch realm, in essence), the CueGlyphs (CuGl) branch of Cipher used as a programming shorthand in-story, or the dialects of various groups.
  
    If/when I ever get around to publishing (and the goal is to try to write a lot of the series or maybe the whole series before trying that, to help make the whole thing as ideal as possible and self-consistent, not wandering like many peoples' works), I might add more here or might make another site for it, unsure.

    In any event, the edutainment connection need not be relevant for your use of Cipher, if you wish to use it.
